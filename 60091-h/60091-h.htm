<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>To my brother Ironmongers, “root and branch,” I dedicate
this “brief history” of our ancient Guild. Notwithstanding
the innumerable facts printed in the following pages, the
work must only be considered as an historical essay upon
the tenth of the twelve “great” Livery Companies of the
City of London. A more elaborate compilation is in progress,
and if my life is spared to complete it that work will
contain the labour of love collections during the past quarter
of a century of an extensive—I may say unique—assortment
of manuscripts and other papers relating to the City,
its Companies, and its Institutions, which will prove, I have
every reason to believe, a most interesting and valuable civic
record.</p>

<p>The present publication has taken place now for several
reasons, some of which I may as well explain. Before
J. P. Malcolm printed the interesting extracts from the Ironmongers’
records in the second volume of his “Londinium
Redivivum,” 1803, very little was known by the general
public about this ancient City Guild. He was followed by
William Herbert, the Guildhall Librarian, in 1834-36, who
published a “History of the Twelve Great Livery Companies,”
with a most valuable introductory essay. Both of
these works are now scarce. In 1851 John Nicholl, Esq,
F.S.A., a Member of the Court of the Ironmongers’ Company,
compiled his “Some Account” of the Guild, taken from their
own records, and this choice volume he enlarged and printed
in 1866. There were, however, only 150 copies circulated
among the Livery and their friends, consequently this history
is more scarce than those issued by Malcolm and Herbert.</p>

<p>When I was elected Yeomanry Warden at Easter, 1888, in
commemoration of the fact that I was one of the Committee
of the Spanish Armada Tercentenary (Plymouth and London)
Commemoration, about which Armada I had published an
essay in 1886, and that the Ironmongers’ Company had
contributed towards the defence of the kingdom exactly
three centuries previous; that the year 1889 was by a curious
coincidence the 700th anniversary of the City Mayoralty;
that several eminent Lord Mayors had been citizens and Ironmongers;
that from my own personal knowledge a large
percentage of the present members of the Yeomanry know
very little of the history of their Guild, or about their
ancient predecessors; and last, but not least, that the
facilities afforded to me by the Editor of the well-known
trade journal, <span class="smcap">The Ironmonger</span>, for the publication in its
columns during the past three months of this “brief history,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
which has had a circulation not second to any other weekly
throughout the world, prompted me to forward a long-cherished
project of compiling for my brethren a short
history, and thus commemorate their kindness for electing
me their representative. The unexpected opportunity of
holding a most enthusiastic meeting on St. Luke’s Day, 1888,
at the London Tavern, opposite Ironmongers’ Hall (our Hall
being temporarily closed), enabled me, as their Warden, to
give to my brother Ironmongers the first historical discourse
relating to the Company (see Chapter VI.), and it helped to
comfort their disappointment in being unable to meet in
their own Hall upon the anniversary of the day they had
assembled therein for nearly three hundred years.</p>

<p>Then, again, there are some personal reasons worth mentioning.
A citizen born, the great-grandson of an eighteenth-century
engineer and ironfounder, the grandson of a ship-owner,
newspaper proprietor, and possessor of the historical
property in the district which he named King’s Cross, and
where to this day several of the great “iron roads” of
England meet, and the son of a publisher and bookseller of
Fleet Street, whose memory and that of my birthplace I
commemorated in 1869 in the “Memorials” of the neighbourhood—in
which year, too, by another remarkable
coincidence, I was honoured by being admitted a member of
the Ironmongers’ Company without the payment of fees—an
honour only conferred on those who perform their duty to
their fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>When the then member for Cork City asked Parliament
twenty years ago to seize the estates of the Companies in
Ireland, I was fortunately enabled by my knowledge of the
subject to assist in the defeat of this wild, revolutionary
scheme of seizing property personally paid for by the
ancestors of the citizens of London. It was the Hon. the
Irish Society and the Companies who voted me their thanks,
and it was my two ever-revered friends, John Nicholl, our
historian, and S. Adams Beck, our then clerk (the father of
our present zealous official)—the memory of whom will long
remain dear, for their portraits hang side by side in our
Court-room—it was their kind notice of my humble efforts,
and their repeated good advice, which helped me to the
honour I so highly valued, and led me to be ever watchful
of our rights and privileges.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago my said dear friend John Nicholl was
Master of the Company (he died in 1871), and this year his
son is our Senior Warden, and (I trust) our next Master.
We wish him every best wish, we heartily pray that the
Almighty will bless us all, and that “the Worshipful Company
of Ironmongers, root and branch,” may be permitted to
“flourish for ever.”</p>

<span class="smaller">OF THE</span><br />
IRONMONGERS’ COMPANY.</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE OLD CITY, ITS CITIZENS AND GUILDS.</span></h2>

<p>In the history of the ancient Livery Companies of London
we read the history and progress of not only the City
but the Empire. During the many centuries of their existence
the Guilds have performed a work for which they
deserve the praise and continued support of not only every
citizen, but every man who to-day enjoys the freedom of
local self-government. There have been kings and prime
ministers who, in their tyrannical measures, have forgotten
the interests of the people and their trades in their desire to
gain unlawful ends, but in every case for hundreds of years
the citizens and the Guilds of London have stood forward to
fight the great battles for freedom, and the continued and
present existence of the Corporation of the ancient City, and
the good work they do to-day, prove, if we carefully read
their history, that to them we are more deeply indebted than
“reformers” choose to acknowledge.</p>

<p>Generations ago “the City” was a very small place, surrounded
by a wall with gates, through which the green fields
and suburbs—then the pleasant villages of Southwark,
Charing, St. Giles, Clerkenwell, Islington, Shoreditch, and
the Tower Hamlets and Stepney—could be reached. These
gates stood at or near the entrances of the present streets
known as Moorgate, Cripplegate, Aldersgate, Newgate,
Ludgate, Billingsgate, Aldgate, and Bishopsgate, so that the
reader can judge what the size of old London was. On the
south side there was the River Thames with its Dowgate,
and between this water-gate and Billingsgate was the entrance
across the only bridge that then spanned the river, which
existed close to where St. Magnus Church now stands—a few
yards east of the present London Bridge. In the suburbs
were many excellent springs of water, known as Holywells,
and at one of these the parish clerks of the City assembled
periodically and held their festivals. The well existed till
late years in Ray Street, close to the Middlesex Sessions
House, and the district is now known as Clerkenwell. The
Parish Clerks’ Company, although not a livery guild, still
exists, and is one of the oldest of the Guilds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>It was long before the time of famous John Stow that
London found a contemporary topographer, for as early as
the year 1179—now 710 years ago—William Fitzstephen
tells us the citizens everywhere “are esteemed the politest of
all others in their manners, their dress, and the elegance and
splendour of their tables,” and he pictures us the City in all
its primitive grandeur, while the citizens themselves were
dignified by the name of barons, a fact borne out by
their description in King John’s charter. Speaking of
this charter reminds us that a brief epitome of the principal
grants, from the Conquest to the reign of Edward IV., when
the Ironmongers’ Company received its incorporation, will
help the reader to more easily comprehend the progress of
the citizens and the Guilds.</p>

<p>There is no document more treasured at Guildhall than
the diminutive parchment which William the Conqueror gave
to the citizens 800 years ago, and upon which we all base our
rights and privileges.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 18em;">
<p class="noindent">I will that ye be worthy<br />
of all those laws which<br />
ye were in King Edward’s day;<br />
and I will that each child<br />
be his father’s heir after his<br />
father’s day, and I will not<br />
suffer that any man do you<br />
wrong. God preserve you.</p>
</div>

<p>In the Confessor’s time “the burgesses” of London had
obtained the king’s warrant for their freedom, and their
children’s heirship, so that their lives and their goods should
be protected from the rapacity of the Lords. The foreign
merchant was only permitted in the City as a lodger, and
was strictly forbidden from selling his wares by retail and
underselling and infringing the rights of his entertainer, the
citizen. Thus do we see nearly a thousand years ago a precaution
taken which we to-day are still clamouring for!</p>

<p>King Henry I., for a quit rent of 300<i>l.</i> per annum, granted
the citizens the Sheriffwick of Middlesex, which 750 years
later has been taken from them. The same monarch also
granted them the privilege of hunting, and it is probably
through this right the Londoners obtained of late years, for
ever, Epping Forest as an open space.</p>

<p>Being dependent upon the king, before the days of charter
rights the citizens were often sorely fleeced upon the slightest
pretence, and in order to protect themselves they in process
of time formed guilds or fraternities of different trades.
Richard I. freed them from toll and lestage throughout
England, and gave them the conservancy of the River Thames,
which right was taken from them some thirty years ago. Of
course King John enlarged their privileges in 1199, for the
City paid him 3,000 marks, and kings would do anything if
you paid them handsomely. Five charters out of eight
granted by Henry III. cost them one-fifteenth of their estate,
and for another, dated 1265, they paid 13,000<i>l.</i> We mention
this to show that having bought these privileges it is unreasonable
to deprive them of their rights without compensation,
and yet this question is never properly understood or
thought of.</p>

<p>In the fifth charter granted by King John (1214) the
citizens of London received the privilege of choosing their
own Mayor from among themselves, and it is to this right
many of the livery companies owe their foundation. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
first Edward permitted the Chief Magistrate to be sworn in
before the Constable at the Tower should the king or his
judges be absent from London; and, furthermore, no stranger
was to be admitted to the City freedom unless six honest
and sufficient members of a mystery or trade be surety. In
1311 Edward II. exempted the citizens from service outside
the City in the time of war or tumult, and for this privilege
the king was favoured with a gift of 2,000 marks.</p>

<p>To King Edward III. the citizens are indebted for many of
their most valued privileges. Thus, in 1327, the Mayor was
instituted one of the judges in trials at the Old Bailey
(Newgate), the right to bring felons from any part of
England and to their goods, the right of devising in Mortmain
and forbidding the holding of markets within seven
miles of the City. And in order to give them control over
such persons as escaped to Southwark to avoid justice, that
ancient village was added to the City liberties (and subsequently
designated Bridge Ward Without). In 1337 the
same king confirmed the rights and privileges, forbidding
“foreign” merchant traders retailing in the City and acting
as brokers; and in 1354 granted a fifth charter, permitting
the Mayor to have gold or silver maces carried before him,
from which time the title of Lord Mayor of London has been
assumed by London’s Chief Magistrate.</p>

<p>Edward IV. was not behind his predecessors in favouring
the citizens, but then it must be noted they paid him some
12,000<i>l.</i> for four charters. In 1462 the Mayor, ex-Mayors,
and Recorder were all made perpetual justices, and were
exempted from serving on juries, &amp;c., while Bartholomew
Fair, with a court of Pie Poudre, was to be held in Smithfield.
And in 1478 they obtained the right of electing a
coroner, and for wine-gauging, &amp;c. As it was Edward IV.
who granted the Ironmongers their charter, we have traced
the progress of the City privileges so far, and leave the
Ironmongers’ records to tell the tale of subsequent progress.</p>

<p>In the course of the preceding remarks the citizens have
been so continually alluded to, that a few notes about them
and what really constituted a citizen will not be out of place
here. In the first place, we think it is not generally known
that every member of a City Company is a citizen of London,
but every citizen is not a member of a Company. There are
two grades of citizens—one free of the City only; the other
free of both City and Company, the latter freeman being
designated as “citizen and ironmonger,” or whatever Company
he may belong to. As the elections or admissions to
all the Companies are the same, that describing the admission
to the Ironmongers’ will be found in a subsequent chapter of
our history.</p>

<p>In all the early charters the general term is “citizens,” but
the Conqueror calls them “burhwarn” (inhabitants or
burgesses of the borough), and John and Henry III. call
them “barons.” The citizens or freemen were the men or
inhabitants of free condition and householders, in contradistinction
to the bondsmen or villains of the great lords.
In the time of Henry III. (1260) all persons of the age of
twelve years and upwards were commanded to swear
allegiance to the king. In 1305 four persons who held land
from the Bishop of London, and dwelt outside the City, were
deprived of their freedom, and about the same time the City
records declare that everyone who is sworn a freeman, and
acts contrary to his oath, should be compelled to “forsweare
the town” and lose his privileges. The statute of the 18th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Edward II. for View of Frankpledge contains a list of articles
still in use, but the statute has been improperly neglected.
In 1326 all alien merchants were directed to be amerced, and
in 1364 it was ordained that a citizen should obtain his
privileges by birth (as a son of a citizen), by servitude (as an
apprentice), or by presentment of a mystery or Guild. In
1377, and for a few years after, it was decreed that members
of the Common Council should only be chosen from the
mysteries, and in 1385 a most important decision was come
to, for upon the complaint of the Mercers and the Drapers
that some persons had been improperly admitted to the
Haberdashers’ and Weavers’ Guilds who were not of those
trades, they were at once expelled the City. In the seventh
year of Edward IV. no freeman or officer of the City was to
be allowed to use the livery of any lord or great man, on pain
of losing his office and freedom, so it is pretty evident the
two evils which at the present time (1889) beset us—foreign
traders and civil servant traders—were not unknown 400
years ago.</p>

<p>We shall conclude this the first chapter of our history by
a brief notice of what is to be understood by the description
“Guild.” In ancient times Guilds or Gilds were of two kinds—religious
and secular. The term “Guilds” is from the Saxon—to
pay, an amerciement or payment towards the support of
a brotherhood. The religious Guilds existed until their
dissolution by Edward VI.; their foundations in some cases
were very early, for at Glemsford, in Suffolk, in Canute’s
time, existed a fraternity of clerks. In London, the
“Cnughts” or “Cnuighten Gild,” of thirteen persons, had
their district or soke outside the City walls, near the Tower,
and was the origin of Portsoken Ward. The Gilda
Theutonicorum, the steel-yard merchants of Dowgate, who
first existed 900 years ago, and held a most important position,
had their guildhall in the neighbourhood where of late
years the iron trade has been so well known (Thames Street),
and yet it must be borne in mind that the definition of <i>steel</i>-yard
was in reality a yard for warehousing general <i>staple</i>
goods, and not solely for steel or iron ware. The transfer of
all trade concerns to the management and jurisdiction of the
Craft Guild was generally accomplished by a confirmation of
their ordinance, that everyone carrying on a trade within
the town should join the Guild, for which the Guild paid
certain taxes—in London to the King—and under Henry I.
(1100-1133), and every succeeding reign, the Weavers paid
a fee-farm rent, and in 1179 no less than eighteen Guilds
were amerced as adulterine, or set up without licence. This
was the same year that Fitzstephen tells us the followers of
the several trades, the vendors of various commodities, and
the labourers of every kind were to be found in their proper
and distinct places. Now, in proof of this, we find that to
this day in the neighbourhood of Cheap (market) side the
streets and lanes still exist wherein the particular trades in
the old City were carried on, viz., Milk Street, Bread Street
Poultry, Cornhill, Wood Street, Candlewick (now Cannon)
Street, and Ironmonger Lane—in which latter thoroughfare
and Old Jewry, close to the Guildhall, the ironmongers of old
London carried on their business, as will be proved in another
chapter.</p>

<p>Many of the ancient Guilds in local places which related
to ironmongers will be mentioned further on, but we may
mention that Walford, speaking of the Reading Cutlers’ and
Bellfounders’ Guilds, tells us that one of their orders was:—“No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
smith may sell iron wares within the borough except
a freeman, on forfeiture of two shillings each time.” Next
to the Saddlers’ and Weavers’ Guilds of London in antiquity
are the Glovers’ and the Blacksmiths’—the latter ordinances
are dated 1434—and of this particular Company the writer
of the present history will at some future time give some
interesting and little known details. Suffice it to say now
that one of the orders particularly ordained: “If eny of the
seid bretheren or there wyves be absent fro oure comon
dyner or elles fro oure quater dai schall paie as moche as if
he or she ware present.” It is proved in this ordinance that
dinners were common with the City Guilds four centuries
ago, and that the wives of the members were of as much
importance to the craft as the members themselves. At the
present day, we regret to find that the ladies are not always
considered with so brotherly an attention as the blacksmiths
considered their ladies in King Henry’s day.</p>

<p>Another of the ancient Guilds was the Farriers’, whose
orders, about the year 1324, included the charges to be made
for shoeing horses, at the rate of a penny halfpenny for six
nails, and twopence for eight nails.</p>

<p>In Buckingham there was a Guild called the Mercers’,
which existed from early days. Even as late as the
seventeenth century the minutes of this Company contained
many very curious entries. For instance, in 1665, when
Thomas Arnott, the eldest son of Walter Arnott, was made
free upon the understanding that he was “to follow the trade
of an ironmonger,” he paid “one gallon of good wyne for
his freedom,” and when his brother Thomas was admitted in
1671 “to follow only ye trade of an ironmonger,” he also
paid the like fee. Upon turning to the ordinances of the
Company we find that the ironmongers of the borough were,
with other trades, associated under the name of the Mercers’,
and that the fifth clause particularly orders “noe strange
pson or fforeigner inhabiting within the said borough or pish,
and not ffree of the same, shall bee made ffree of the said
Companies to the intent to sell or utter any kind of wares
usually solde by any artificier, before such time as every such
strange or forrein pson have paid for his freedome”—the
sums specified in a schedule annexed, and which “for every
ironmonger” was 20<i>l.</i>, and “one good leather buckett for the
use of the said Corporation,” and that the son of such person
or freeman so admitted shall, upon being made free of the
Company “whereunto he hath beene an apprentice in forme
aforesaid,” pay to “the bayliffe and burgesses and his Company
one gallon of good wyne.”</p>

<p>As we proceed with our history we shall find some curious
facts connected with the London ironmongers, and that
their ordinances, quaint and still in force, contain many very
illustrative evidences of the trade-unions of centuries ago.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller">IRON, IRONWORKS, AND IRONMONGERS.</span></h2>

<p>Iron and its uses historically described should form no
unimportant part to the history of the Ironmongers’
Company, but as it is not our intention now to give the
thousand-and-one notes which would form a most interesting
and valuable compendium to the general account of the
City Guild, it is sufficient for us if we so condense our large
store of material and give such an epitome as will assist the
reader to comprehend the origin of the trade of which the
company bears the name.</p>

<p>A well-known writer justly observes that no one should
fail to consider the origin, history, and value of iron; that
our instruments of cutlery, the tools of our mechanics, and
the countless machines which we construct by the infinitely
varied applications of iron are derived from ore for the most
part coeval with or more ancient than the fuel by the aid of
which we reduce it to its metallic state, and apply it to
innumerable uses in the economy of human life. The use of
iron is identified with the time of erecting the Egyptian
monuments, the oldest in the world, and a very large number
of the helmets dug up at Nineveh were made of iron, and
some of copper inlaid. Readers of history have only to turn
to the pages of Anderson, Fosbroke, Scrivenor, Layard, and
others to learn that iron has ever been a most useful and
valuable article of commerce.</p>

<p>The Romans proved their constructive ingenuity by the
manufacture of those innumerable articles of iron which
from time to time have been dug up throughout England,
particularly in those districts where woods and forests at one
time existed. In Gloucestershire the Forest of Dean for
centuries had the extensive furnaces about which so many
battles were fought in and out of Parliament, and in Sussex
the sites of the ancient ironworks in the Weald can be
traced to this day, and will be found described in Lower’s
“Historical and Archæological Notices,” printed in the second
volume of the Sussex Collections. In the reign of the
Conqueror Gloucestershire possessed a large trade in the
forging of iron for the King’s navy, and in Edward I.’s
time seventy-two furnaces were kept employed. As we
progressed, England discovered that the iron we manufactured
was wanted for home use, consequently Edward III.
prohibited its exportation.</p>

<p>In the accounts for carrying on the war in 1513 there is
an item mentioning “nailes and yeran worke,” and just
thirty years later (according to Holinshed) the first cast-iron
cannon was made at Buxted, in Sussex, by Rafe Hoge and
Peter Bawde. Among the State Papers there are a quantity
relating to the casting of cannon not only in Sussex, but in
other counties. The Lamberhurst furnace was a large
foundry, for the woods of the Weald were plentiful, and here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
at a cost of 11,202<i>l.</i>, were produced the 2,500 fine iron railings
and seven iron gates, weighing 200 tons and 81 lbs., for
the enclosure of Wren’s Cathedral of St. Paul’s, London. It
is worthy of note that as early as 1290 Master Henry of
Lewes received a payment for the ironwork of the monument
of Henry III. in Westminster Abbey. The parish of
Mayfield was famous for its iron; at the palace were preserved
many relics, and among these the hammer, anvil, and
tongs of St. Dunstan. Lower says “they seem to refer as
much to the iron trade, so famous in these parts, as to the
alleged proficiency of the Saint in the craft of a blacksmith.
The hammer and tongs are of no great antiquity, but the
hammer with its iron handle may be considered a mediæval
relic.” The old legend of St. Dunstan and his successful
encounter with “the Evil one” must form part of the
history of the blacksmiths, and will not be an uninteresting
portion of their “mystery.” In 1559 the value of iron and
ironwork brought into the port of London, “the excess of
which is prejudicial to the realm,” is set down in a State
Paper to be 19,559<i>l.</i> In 1622 Thomas Covell and others
received a certificate permitting them to sell round iron shot
at 11<i>l.</i> per ton.</p>

<p>In the reign of Elizabeth there are two most interesting
notices in manuscript. The first of the year 1574, the second
of the Armada year 1588. Nowadays we are used to
“company promoting,” but three centuries ago there was as
wild a scheme countenanced by Her Majesty’s Ministers as
ever was floated to-day. Strype, in his “Annals” (quoting
the original MSS.), says “a great project has been carrying
on now for two or three years of alchymy, William Medley
being the great undertaker to turn iron into copper. Sir
Thomas Smith, Secretary of State, had by some experiments
made before him a great opinion of it,” so had the great
Lord Burleigh, the Earl of Leicester, Sir Humphrey Gilbert,
and others, each of whom speculated, with the result that
Her Majesty (for certain royalties allowed her) granted them
a patent in January, 1574, incorporating them as the
“Governor and Society of the New Art” ... “for making
copper and quicksilver by the way of transmutation with the
commodities growing of that mystery.” Twenty persons
only were to form the company; to “dig open and work for
any mines, owers, and things whatsoever.” Sundry sums of
100<i>l.</i> each were subscribed by Burleigh, Smith &amp; Co., but
“the concern” did not prosper. The assay master at the
Tower mint was sent to “the works,” and so was Robert
Denham, a relative, by the way, of the Sir Wm. Denham who
had been seven times Master of the Ironmongers’ Company;
but somehow or other we fail, as Strype failed with all the
papers before him, to learn “the wind up” of what was
thought to be “a most splendid investment.”</p>

<p>Now in 1588 there was the original certificate given by
“John Colman, of the Kanc, gent,” of “Chardges belonging to a
furnace for making a fowndry of iron for one whole weeke” at
Canckwood (Cannock Wood?), co. Stafford. According to this
document, for one ton the furnace cost 110<i>s.</i> 10½<i>d.</i>, and the
forge 69<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>; total, 9<i>l.</i> 0<i>s.</i> 0½<i>d.</i> Seven years previous to
this, the Act of Elizabeth, “Touching yron milles neere unto
the Cittie of London and the Ryver of Thames,” enacted that
in consequence of the great consumption of wood as fuel for
these mills, no woods within 22 miles of the City should be
converted “to cole or other fewell for the making of iron or
iron mettell in any iron milles furnes or hammer,” except the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
woods of the wealds of Surrey, Sussex, and Kent, and the
woods of Christopher Darrell, of Newdigate, Surrey, gent,
and who had already preserved his woods for his own ironworks.</p>

<p>Speaking of patents and Acts of Parliament recalls a note
or two which may as well be stated here. In 1676 Samuel
Hutchinson, citizen and ironmonger of London, had a patent
granted to him for his invention, “a newe way of melting
downe leade oare into good and mallyable mettall with
minerall coales commly called sea coales and pitt coales,
which hath byn approved of by many prsons dealing in leade
and other artists.” In 1766 John Purnell, of Froombridge,
Gloucester, ironmaster, invented a new machine for making
ship-bolts and rods of iron and steel. Between these dates
there were several patents granted to ironmongers, but the
patents were for numerous inventions quite apart from the
trade.</p>

<p>We have stated that the Ironmongers are known to have
existed many years previous to their incorporation in 1463.
Now, according to the ancient City records, called “Liber
Horn,” compiled in the reign of Edward I., (and
quoted by Stow and others), the “Feroners,” or dealers in
iron, about the year 1300 complained to the Mayor (Elias
Russel) and the aldermen “for that the smiths of the wealds
and other merchants bringing down irons of wheels for carts
to the City of London they were much shorter than was
anciently, to the great loss and scandal of the whole trade of
ironmongers.” Whereupon an inquisition was taken, and
three rods of the just length of the strytes, and the length
and breadth of the gropes belonging to the wheels of carts
were presented and sealed with the City seal. One was
deposited in the Chamber of London, Guildhall, and the other
two handed to John Dode and Robert Paddington, the
ironmongers of the market, and John Wymondham, ironmonger
of the Bridge, who were accordingly sworn to oversee
for the benefit of the trade, and empowered to seize all
unjust and less-sized irons in future. This reference is particularly
interesting, for it not only proves the existence of
“the trade” at least one hundred and sixty years before the
incorporation of the Ironmongers, but gives us an insight
into the way complaints were redressed nearly six hundred
years ago.</p>

<p>In Causton’s introduction to “Mildmay on City Elections,”
we are told that in a few years after the accession of
Edward III. a silent revolution had been accomplished—the
gildated crafts by the enrolment of the special freemen,
householders of the wards each in his mystery, had obtained
an exclusively civic importance, paramount to the mixed
character of the inhabitants of the wards as civic divisions,
and the reconstruction of the City from a territorial to a
trading classification had become complete. Thus, in the
twenty-fifth year of Edward III., 1351, a precept was directed
to the wardens of the City Guilds by the Mayor (which precept
formerly had been directed to the men of each ward),
and in this precept each of the thirty-three mysteries was
directed to select from their number four persons, who were
to join the others of the Companies in a consultation with
the Mayor and Sheriffs on the business of the City. The
Ironmongers accordingly selected their two wardens and two
others to represent them, and from this date they claim
their existence as a Guild. In 1363 (37 Edward III.), when
these Companies were called upon for “an offering” to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
King to enable him to carry on the war in France, the then
large sum of 452<i>l.</i> 16<i>s.</i> was contributed, and the Ironmongers
supplied 6<i>l.</i> 18<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> It is worthy of note that upon this
occasion in precedency on the list it stood eleventh, while
to-day, some 500 years later, its precedency on the list
of City Companies is the tenth. Of this precedency, which
was a serious question in olden time, we shall have to say a
few words later on in our history.</p>

<p>We have now to mention a most interesting circumstance,
which has only recently been discovered. Among the
enrolled letters at Guildhall which between 1350 and 1370
were sent from the Corporation to many persons, and which
Dr. Sharpe, the Records Clerk, so ably edited for the City
four years ago, there is one written in French, and dated
the 18th of October, the 38th Edward III. (1364), and directed
to some persons whose names have not been preserved, but
then residents at Bury—probably Bury St. Edmunds, in
Suffolk—“desiring them to assist Thomas de Mildenhale,
citizen and ironmonger of London, to recover his runaway
apprentice, Andrew, the son of William Bruwere, who is
understood to be staying in the town of Bury, in such
manner as they would wish their folk to be treated in like
case or weightier. The Lord have them ever in his keeping.”
We are not told, and are not likely to know now, whether
this runaway “merry” Andrew was brought back, and, if so,
how the Chamberlain received him. In subsequent days a
runaway apprentice would have “little ease” at the hands of
the Guildhall caretaker of a citizen’s conscience.</p>

<p>We shall include in this second chapter of our history
another most interesting document which Mr. Riley found
when making his extracts from the Guildhall treasures a few
years ago. It is nothing more or less than the appraisement
of the goods and chattels of Stephen le Northerne, in the
thirtieth year of Edward III. (1356), and gives us a very
curious picture of what an ironmonger’s shop contained at
that date. It would appear that the goods were in the
house of one John Leche, in the parish of St. Michael, Cornhill,
on June 6 that year, and that the appraisers were

<p>This inventory is very curious, and, as inventories of so
early a date are very rare, we could not resist the temptation
of quoting one, especially when it related to an ironmonger’s
shop. Now, it appears that the whole of these goods and
chattels, together with one tenement, three shops, and one
alley, situated in the parish of St. Michael, Cornhill, and
valued at fourteen shillings yearly (rents in Cornhill were
reasonable in those days), were delivered over to Simon
Palmer, “pelterer,” and William Sunnyng, “carpenter,” by
the Mayor and Aldermen, to be holden in trust for the use of
Alice, the daughter of John Leche aforesaid, when she came
of age. As the premises appear to have been shortly afterwards
burnt to the ground, the trustees had to rebuild, and
on folio 45 of the Corporation Letter Book G Mr. Riley
found the cost of such restoration.</p>

<p>In our first chapter we stated it was in 1377 that by enactment
the Common Council and other officials of the City
were directed to be elected from the mysteries instead of by
the Wards, as theretofore. This privilege, although only
temporarily enjoyed as regarded the Council, yet has continued,
so far as the Liverymen being the elective body of
the City officials, down to the present time, notwithstanding
that 500 years have passed by since the passing of the Act;
and, looking at the list of names of the persons chosen and
the many notable individuals, styled by old Stow under the
heading, “Honor of citizens and worthinesse of men in the
same,” there are few persons who carefully and without
prejudice study the facts but will agree with us that the
Livery have never neglected their duty, but have, as a rule,
only elected those persons who would do their duty to their
country, to their Sovereign, and to their brethren in the
City. We sincerely trust that, whenever any elective
franchise is conferred upon the Londoners at large, they will
execute their trust with as good and unbiased a judgment.
In our next chapter we shall tell how the Ironmongers carried
out their trust after their foundation as a Guild and an
Incorporated Company of the City of London.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE WORSHIPFUL COMPANY OF IRONMONGERS.</span></h2>

<p>Although existing records do not give us all the information
we should like to have about the ancient history of
the Guilds, we have, nevertheless, been able to show that by
their joining in the election of the City officials in the year
1351, and choosing four of their members (John Deynes and
Richard de Eure, wardens, and Henry de Ware and William
Fromond), “the wisest and most sufficient” in the Guild, to
treat with the Mayor and Sheriffs upon the “serious business”
of the City, that the Ironmongers were duly recognised
thus early as a firmly-established brotherhood.</p>

<p>The “market,” or special place of business of the fraternity,
was, as we have said, in the neighbourhood of the
City Guildhall, and hence the existing name of Ironmonger
Lane, which is a thoroughfare out of Cheapside, on the
north side, and the next turning to the Old Jewry westward,
between which streets to this day stands a church, known as
St. Olave’s (about to be removed), the predecessors of which—St.
Martin’s, Ironmonger’s Lane, and St. Olave—contained
the remains of several eminent ironmongers, including
William Dikeman, “Feroner,” one of the sheriffs, 1367;
Robert Havelocke, 1390; Thomas Michell, 1527; Richard
Chamberlain, 1562. At what date the craft left this neighbourhood
is unknown. We know they possessed the Ironmongers’
Hall, more east, near Billiter Street, in the middle
of the fifteenth century, about which district the members
individually may have carried on business; Strype, however,
stating that when they removed from their old market they
took up a position in Thames Street, wherein to this day, as
is well known, the iron wharves and warehouses are numerous
and extensive.</p>

<p>The precedency question in the olden time was a momentous
one for the City Guilds, and led to many conflicts between
the members of certain companies, which will be mentioned
when speaking of “the Livery” and “apprentices” hereafter.
It is worthy of note here to remark that in the year
1376(7), the fiftieth of Edward III., forty-eight Guilds elected
148 of their members as the Common Council, when the
Ironmongers, standing the thirty-fifth in the list, elected
four of their number. We imagine that no actual precedency
was here followed, for in subsequent lists the “great”
companies contained first thirteen names, and eventually
twelve, in which the Ironmongers stood eighth, eleventh,
and, finally, tenth, a position assigned them not so much for
their wealth, but probably for their respectability, or, as old
Stow says, “the worthiness of the men,” and the power they
possessed.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Fifteenth-century Maple-wood Mazer-bowl.</span> (<a href="#Page_47">See page 47.</a>)</p>
</div>

<p>Again, from these great companies the Lord Mayor was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
always chosen. The first Mayor was Henry Fitzalwyn,
“Draper,” near the London Stone, which is an ancient City
relic still existing (but not on its original site) in Cannon
Street, not many yards from the office of <span class="smcap">The Ironmonger</span>,
in which this history is first published exactly 700 years
afterwards, for Fitzalwyn was first chosen in 1189, and continued
to hold office twenty-four successive years. As we
have said, the Lord Mayor was always “one of the Twelve”;
but in 1742 Sir Robert Wilmot, “Cooper,” declining to be
“translated” to the Clothworkers (as was the custom when
the Mayor elect was of a minor company), and there being
no law to compel him, he was consequently the first Mayor
not of the great companies; and it is a curious fact that
Wilmot’s predecessor in office was an ironmonger, and to
this day the Coopers and the Ironmongers are associated in
the Irish estate.</p>

<p>After a lapse of 500 years it will be interesting to many,
and to those who object to oath-taking in particular, if we
give in its original form the wording of the Ironmongers’
Warden’s oath required to be taken before admission in the
fiftieth year of Edward III. Its quaint phraseology must be
our excuse for the transcript:—“Yᵉ shall swere that yᵉ
shall wele and treuly ov’see the Craft of Iremongers’ wherof
yᵉ be chosen Wardeyn for the yeere. And all the goode
reules and ordynces of the same craft that been approved
here be the Court, and noon other, yᵉ shal kepe and doo to
be kept. And all the defautes that yᵉ fynde in the same
Craft ydon to the Chambleyn of yᵉ Citee for the tyme beyng,
yᵉ shal wele and treuly P’sente. Sparyng noo man for favor
ne grevyng noo p’sone for hate. Extorcion ne wrong under
colour of your office yᵉ shall non doo, nethir to noo thing
thot shalbe ayenst the State, peas, and profite of oure
Sovereyn Lord the Kyng or to the Citee yᵉ shall not consente,
but for the tyme that yᵉ shalbe in office in all things thot
shalbe longyng unto the same craft after the lawes and
ffranchises of the seide Citee welle and laufully yᵉ shal have
you. So helpe you God and all Seyntes.”</p>

<p>In 1397, one of the years of “Dick Whittington” as Lord
Mayor, a curious case came before the Court of Aldermen
for decision. William Sevenoake, a native of Sevenoaks, in
Kent, and who, subsequent to the date we mention, was
Sheriff and Mayor of London, and founder of the schools
and almshouses at Sevenoaks, prayed the Court to be
enrolled on the Grocers’ Company, notwithstanding in his
apprenticeship his master Hugh de Boys was called an ironmonger.
The Grocers having proved the facts, William was
accordingly entered as a grocer, and 40<i>s.</i> paid for the
privilege.</p>

<p>Before their incorporation, the Ironmongers were represented
by three Mayors of London, viz., Sir Richard Marlow,
1409-10, and again, 1417-18, and by Sir John Hatherley,
1442-43, and yet, after their incorporation, and not until the
year 1566-67 did another ironmonger fill the “chair,”
although several sheriffs represented the Guild both before
and after their charter was granted.</p>

<p>Herbert, the Guildhall librarian of half a century ago,
speaking of the compulsory enrolment of the Companies’
charters, “regretted exceedingly that so little could be found
about the ancient state of the City Guilds among the State
papers and records preserved by the nation.” If the zealous
literary citizen had only known then what we know to-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
he would not only have regretted, but denounced in the
strongest terms (as we do now), the gross mismanagement of
the State Paper Office in the past and the red-tapeism of the
present time, the former losing to us for ever most valuable
records, the latter placing every obstacle possible in the way
of the documents now remaining being conveniently used by
historians, the publication of the contents thereof greatly
helping towards their future preservation. In our searches
at the Public Record Office for the purpose of this history,
we have experienced this inconvenience, and we certainly
consider it should not exist in a Government institution
supported by the public. When we find the authorities at
the British Museum, and the Guildhall, and other repositories
open to us, and giving every facility with their records,
which, after all, embrace priceless treasures and quite as
worthy of safe custody, the restrictions placed upon literary
research by the Master of the Rolls and the Record Office
officials is really worthy a Royal Commission of inquiry.</p>

<p>When Henry VII. entered the City in 1485 the Guilds supplied
435 members to meet the King, and of these ten were
Ironmongers. In the year 1504 there was a subscription of
the sixty-one Companies, amounting to 313<i>l.</i> 16<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, towards
the erection of the kitchen and offices at Guildhall, and 5<i>l.</i>
was the sum the Ironmongers gave. It must be borne in
mind that in those days a small sum went a long way.</p>

<p>We now arrive at an interesting period of the Company’s
history. Eight years previous to obtaining their charter of
incorporation the Ironmongers obtained a grant of arms.
Both charter and grant have been repeatedly exhibited and
described, and beautiful facsimiles of the two documents
will be found in Mr. G. R. French’s “Catalogue of the Ironmongers’
Exhibition of Antiquities,” in 1861, a most
sumptuously printed and privately circulated work, and now
very scarce.</p>

<p>By warrant dated September 1, the thirty-fourth of
Henry VI. (1455), “Lancastre, Kyng of Armes,” and the
College of Arms granted “Unto the honurable Crafte and
felasship of the ffraunchised men of Iremongers of the Citie
of London a token of armes, that is to sey: Silver a cheveron
of Gowles sitte betwene three gaddes of stele of asure, on
the cheueron three swevells of golde: with two lizardes
of theire owne kynde encoupled with gowlys, on the
helmet.”</p>

<p>The two lizards on the helmet, it must be borne in mind,
represent the crest. “The Crafte” and their successors
were to hold and enjoy these arms “for evermore,” and the privilege
of using a tabard upon all state occasions. Clarenceux,
King at Arms, inspected the original grant in 1530-31, and
signed its confirmation, and in 1560 William Hervy, another
Clarenceux, curiously enough upon inspecting the same document,
found the patent “to be without good authoryte,” and
therefore, either to ease his conscience or that of the College,
or for the more likely reason to be mentioned presently, confirms
once again the same grant of “armes, helme, and
crest” to “the Corporacon, Company, and Comynalty, and to
their successors for evermore,” to use the same “in shylde
banners, standardes, and otherwyse,” and “without impedyment
or interuption of any person or persons,” for the confirmation
of which privilege, already enjoyed for one hundred
years, the Ironmongers’ books, Mr. Nicholl tells us, show that
“Mayster Clarensys” received thirty-seven shillings, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
“his svant for bringing them hom” twelve pence for his
own use.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the official granting and confirmation,
another gentleman from the college, this time the Richmond
Herald, inspected the same document, and he too did the
Company the honour in 1634 of again “confirming” the same
grants, so that it is impossible to deny to the Ironmongers
the right and privilege of bearing arms; and one fact is
certain, if ever a Corporation or Brotherhood possessed
appropriate armorials suggestive of their trade it is this
Guild, which cannot be said of the armorial shields of many
other City Companies.</p>

<p>Now, we have gone into this matter of the granting of the
arms and the three confirmations beyond the usually allotted
space in histories for the simple reason that one of the most
extraordinary circumstances in connection with heraldic
grants has yet to be explained. The Ironmongers’ Company,
although possessing a grant which has been thrice confirmed
by the College, and in which the two lizards appear as a
crest, never received from either of the Heralds who were
good enough for a consideration to inspect and confirm an
authority which each ought to have given, to use “supporters”
to the armorial shield, or, if the Company had no
right to use them, to inquire the reason why, &amp;c., when such
were assumed.</p>

<p>The Company adopting the supporters, two lizards, as in
the crest, Edmondson, another Herald, in 1780 actually
stated in his Heraldic work that they were given the Company
in one of the confirmations! In 1812 the question
again came before Garter, King of Arms, when the
Collegians were good enough to say that the Ironmongers
might have a “confirmation” of the supporters upon paying
the modest fee of 73<i>l.</i> It is needless to say that the Company
declined to pay this (in our opinion) extortionate
demand, and so to this day (as it has exercised from a
period long before this century dawned) the Ironmongers
bear their supporters, as only true citizens should.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to note here that in many armorial
shields of private families there are similarities to that of the
Ironmongers’, except that, in place of the chevron between
three gads of steel, there are a chevron between three billets
of wood, and it is particularly interesting to call attention to
the fact that such a coat is to be found in a seal dated 1359,
and still more curious that in the deed on which this seal
appears three ironmongers are mentioned: John Deynes,
William Dikeman, and Henry de Ware. This was nearly a
century previous to the Company receiving a grant of arms.</p>

<p>The lizards, now used by the Ironmongers as crest and
supporters, were also used when naming their manor in
Ireland in the reign of James I., now known as the “Manor
of Lizard,” and about which we shall speak hereafter. Mr.
Herbert, fifty years ago, remarks:—“What are in the arms
termed ‘lizards,’ we may rather imagine were intended to
represent salamanders—a creature supposed, like iron, to
live unhurt in fire.” Pennant says:—“The frolicsome agility
of lizards enlivens the dried banks in hot climates, and the
great affection which some of them show to mankind should
further engage our regard and attention.” Another writer
quaintly suggests that the dear little animal not only loves
iron, but likes it hot, eating it with a relish, and digests it
with ease. See also the head-piece to Herbert’s “History.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the armorials is the Company’s motto, and that is,
appropriately, “God is our strength.” It is not known when
this was assumed, but the date is modern, for anciently—at
all events, in the seventeenth century—the Ironmongers’
motto was “Assher Dure,” which a well-known antiquary
translates as “steel endures,” and will be found in the
heraldic volume of Companies’ arms in the British Museum.</p>

<p>A most important step was now taken, which in the history
of the Guild at once entitled it to the style of “worshipful.”
In 1463 it obtained a charter of incorporation. Written in
Latin, it is not a lengthy document, but is interesting, and
prettily illuminated in gold and colours, with the royal arms
within the initial letter “E” of Edwardus, and another
shield of the Company’s arms in the margin beneath.
Pendant is a fine specimen of the royal seal of England,
circular in size, in green wax, dated Westminster, March 20,
the third year of Edward IV., then 1462, but, since the
alteration of the calendar, now 1463. The King grants:
“To our well-beloved and faithful liegemen all the freemen
of the mystery and art of Iremongers of our City of London
and suburbs thereof” the rights and privileges to be a body
corporate for evermore, to have a master and two wardens
(who are named as Richard Flemming, alderman; and
Nicholas Marchall and Robert Toke) and a commonalty, with
perpetual succession, under the name of “the master and
keepers or wardens and commonalty of the mystery or art of
Ironmongers of London,” to have a common seal, make
ordinances, to purchase and hold lands and tenements to the
value of 10 marks yearly.</p>

<p>The day upon which the Guild received their incorporation
charter they, doubtless, celebrated with all the
ceremonials and festivities which we, 400 years afterwards,
indulge in to-day, and they recorded in their books a resolution:
“That they shalle holde and kepe the said feste for
their principall fesst, evermore.”</p>

<p>Ironmongers’ Hall in Fenchurch Street will be described
in another chapter, but we may as well state that the site of
the present building was granted in the year 1457 by the
executors of Alice Stivard, the widow of Sir John Stivard,
Knight, to the nineteen “citizen and ironmongers” mentioned
(among whom were the three named in the charter), and
that in the Company’s books occurs the entry, “Bought by
the for wreten ffelowshipp and paid fore, and also posesson
taken the XX daie of Octobr the XXXVI yer of King Henry
the VI.”</p>

<p>Now, what do our reforming friends in 1889 say to this?
There is nothing said about trusts here. It is as much the
Company’s freehold and belongs to them, the “root and
branch” descendants, as ever the commonest article that may
be purchased (and paid for, mark ye!) by any citizen and
working-man to-day. So, in simply quoting the purchase
here, we do so to put all reformers on their guard not to be
so ready to make hay (by their seizure) before the sun shines
on assumed or presumed rights.</p>

<p>But we will go a little further. The Company did not buy
without legal aid, for the books show “lernyd counsaile at
the purchas makyng” received not only 26<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for their
advice and labours, but there was paid “at taverns dyvers
tymes” for refreshments to the same gentlemen the large
sum of 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Having purchased a house and garden, and regularly gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
into housekeeping, the Ironmongers began their furnishing
in humble style. Among the first articles purchased were the
following:—</p>

<p>It must not be said that the Worshipful Company of
Ironmongers commenced incorporated existence extravagantly.
And we shall be able to show in our next chapter
that, as they began so they continued, careful in the management
of their charity trusts, and frugal in all matters
pertaining to their government.</p>

<span class="smaller">FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OF THE IRONMONGERS’
HISTORY.—I.</span></h2>

<p>Although Mr. Alderman Cotton, one of the Parliamentary
City Companies’ Commissioners, reported five
years ago “that the returns made to the Commission show
conclusively that the members of the Livery Companies were
never exclusively of the trade the name of which was borne
by their Company, and that for about 400 years the
larger proportion of the members have not pretended to
follow the crafts of their Companies,” and that “the Livery
Companies are not to be classed with friendly or benevolent
societies, with monastic institutions, or with political or
other clubs, but rather approached the character of a
masonic body, exercising in the past and at the present
time a very good and important moral influence not only
upon citizens and City life, but upon public life generally,”
and foremost in the promotion of education and charitable
acts, we shall show that, like many other of the Companies,
the Ironmongers’ has never proved indifferent to its particular
trade or its kindred associations.</p>

<p>It was contended before the Commissioners in 1882 that
the whole of the charters of the Companies are bad because
the King parted with his right to grant charters conferring
the right of search. Without attempting to enter into the
question, or debate the correctness of such an assertion, as
only a lawyer could and would in “the good old times,”
upon the power of the sovereign to make a grant which
has stood the test of centuries, no such right is to be found
in either of the Ironmongers’ charters. The records of the
Company show that statutory legislation for the protection
and regulation of the iron trade was enacted in the reign of
Henry IV., Richard III., Henry VIII., and Edward VI., and
that on certain occasions this Company have laid abuses of
the trade before the Common Council that they might deal
therewith, this company not having the power in itself.
Amongst its own commonalty only the Ironmongers’ exercised
supervision and control of trading, but as none of the
trade joined the Company other than of their own free will
and for their own good, obedience to such control can only
be regarded as voluntary, and not as infringing the liberty
of the subject contrary to the provisions of Magna Charta.</p>

<p>We therefore desire in the present chapter, while giving
a chronicle of the Ironmongers’ progress during the past
400 years, to show that the old City Guild has a history in
many respects peculiarly its own, and that since its incorporation
it has frequently proved most valuable to the State,
the City, and the people.</p>

<p>And yet the Ironmongers as brethren have had their
troubles. Witness the City Sheriff of 1479, Robert Byfield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
by name and Ironmonger by Company, who, with Sir
Bartholomew James, the then Lord Mayor, attended prayers
at St. Paul’s Cathedral, and had the audacity to kneel too
close to his Civic Majesty. His Lordship chid him for the
affront; Mr. Sheriff resented the scolding, and the end of
the extraordinary squabble was that the Court of Aldermen
tried the case, and fined Mr. Byfield, who, says Stow,
“payd 50<i>l.</i> towards the water conduits,” one of which, the
great conduit in Cheapside, was then building. Our Sheriff,
who resided in Tower Street, did not long survive the trial,
for he died in 1482, and by his will proved he was far from
being unmindful of religious or charitable influences, for he
not only founded a chapel and made many bequests, but did
not forget his poorer brethren in Fenchurch Street.</p>

<p>But not alone and personally have the Ironmongers
suffered. Our early Monarchs appear to have considered the
rich and powerful Citizens a fair field for plunder. While
Royalty was privileged to run to excesses, and by extravagance
spent the income their loyal subjects provided, the
Citizens, because they exercised their moral and more
business-like spirit of showing a balance on the right side of
the ledger, were made victims of repeated extortions. It is
no use denying, and unjust to deny, that our Sovereigns have
so loved London as to sacrifice their comfort or their greed
by visiting it for other than personal motives, and the
records show but too plainly that Royalty in the past has
depended upon the wealth of “a nation of shopkeepers” for
a constant supply of the “needful.” The Royal draw upon
the City purse commenced early in London’s existence, and
great has been the loss to the Citizens; and yet to-day there
are those who still clamour for the extinction of the very
source which has kept the nation alive! Our remarks are
not overdrawn, as our proofs are many—too many, in fact, to
be detailed at large. One or two must suffice now.</p>

<p>Beginning, then, more than 350 years ago, King Henry VIII.
set a bad example to his descendants. Having asked the
City for 20,000<i>l.</i>—only as a loan, of course—in the year 1523,
he, the more readily to raise it, “comandyed to have all the
money and platt that was belonging to every hawlle or
craft,” and so the poor Ironmongers had to pay up among
the other Companies. The book sorrowfully records, “At
the whyche comandmentt he had all oure money,” and that
amounting to only 25<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>, the plate was pawned or sold,
realising 46<i>l.</i> more, or a total of 71<i>l.</i> 14<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>; and even then,
not being satisfied, twenty of the richest members of the
Company “lent” him out of their own pockets something
like 190<i>l.</i>, “Mr. Willm Denham oure Warden” heading the
list with 30<i>l.</i> We hope he was repaid, but we doubt it.</p>

<p>The King having obtained this “little loan” so easily did not
forget to be “a suitor” to the City again; but the next time
the Ironmongers went to the Pawnbrokers was in 1544, when
they “layd to plege, the xxij. day of May,” their ewers,
salts, and cups, to provide “xiiij. men in harnes to goe over
the see wᵗʰ the Kyngs army in to France, that was iiij. bowmen
and x. byll men” fully equipped for service. Now we
do not intend to quote every occasion when the Sovereign
borrowed money, but a few selected cases will tell the tale.
In 1575 a precept from the Lord Mayor commanded the
Company to assist the Queen’s demand by paying 60<i>l.</i>, coolly
adding, “if youe have not soe moche in store then you shale
borrowe the same at ynterest at thonly costs and lossis of
yoʳ hall.” Next year the Queen commanded the City to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
raise and hold in readiness for her 140,000<i>l.</i>, and a few years
later, in 1588, the celebrated Armada year, when every county
in England lent its thousands to assist in the defence of the
nation, and the Companies of the City advanced 51,900<i>l.</i>,
we find the Ironmongers’ proportion was 2,300<i>l.</i> (“The
City Guilds Subscription Lists,” in “The Western Antiquary,”
May, 1888), raised among fourteen of the wealthiest
members. In 1598 the Queen’s Privy Council sent for
20,000<i>l.</i> more, and the Ironmongers lent 880<i>l.</i> In 1614, the
treasury being empty, and Parliament dissolved, the King
asked for 100,000<i>l.</i>; but the City was far from prosperous
that year. Government demands, the Ulster and Virginia
plantations, and other calls had drained the City purse; and
it was only after several meetings that the Ironmongers
obliged His Majesty by making “a benevolence” of 179<i>l.</i>
And when, in 1620, another demand was made, and the
Company granted 170<i>l.</i>, the members were compelled for a
time to be so economical that not only were all their dinners
stopped, but they actually fined each other so that the
current expenses could be paid. And still the obnoxious and
oppressive precepts poured in. In 1627, in 1628, in 1630,
the citizens were truly “dearly beloved” to the King, and
when, in 1640 and 1642, the Parliamentary demands for
another trifling “loan” of 100,000<i>l.</i> made matters more and
more disheartening, the Ironmongers were forced to part
with 3,400<i>l.</i>, and another advance a little later made the
Government a debtor to the Company in the year 1652 of no
less a sum than 9,536<i>l.</i> 3<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> If we calculate what was
owing to the other Corporations at the same time at only
half this sum each, is it to be wondered at that there were
civil wars, or that the extravagances of the “Merry Monarch”
and his saintly brother James brought about in succession
the shutting up of the Exchequer and the revolution of two
centuries ago?</p>

<p>The Ironmongers had all along proved to be such true
friends to the State that they found out to their cost, and
too late, that they had not been true to themselves. Their
account with the Government and their Royal masters of
fifty years before still remained unsettled, and to so low a
pitch had their exchequer fallen that in 1691 they were again
compelled to pawn their plate for 253<i>l.</i>, and no longer trust
to the promises or bonds of their debtors. And so, striking
off the balance of 5,000<i>l.</i> as a bad debt, they determined in
future to trust only those who were trustworthy. But even
the loss or money, and having to pawn their plate and
valuables, were not their only troubles. The harassing
demands of the State at times were so oppressive that it
makes us wonder the City did not revolt sooner than it did
and shut its gates to tyranny as Derry did in 1688. Only one
example of oppression need I give here. In 1675 the Hearth
Tax collector called in Fenchurch Street and demanded
4<i>l.</i> 16<i>s.</i> for “chimney money” for two empty houses, belonging
to the Company, then standing between the present Queen
Victoria and Thames Streets. The Ironmongers declined to
pay the demand, whereupon (says the record) “he (the collector)
did, wᵗʰ his consorts and constable, goe upp into the
hall and took away one of the Company’s salts.” This was
distressing with a vengeance, everyone will admit, and, notwithstanding
that we think empty houses to-day should pay
their share of taxation and thus lighten parochial rates, we
do not advocate the sharp practice of King Charles’s
collector.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us now take a rapid review of the Company’s history
as applicable to the trade. If they did not possess the right
of search or the power over the trade generally, like some of
the other Guilds, they by advice and action with the Corporation
and Companies have upon many occasions
proved most beneficial and valuable. The earliest ordinances
of the Guild are of the date 1498. They provide
for the elections of the Master and Wardens
“wᵗʰ tokens of garlands on their heds,” the charge
of purchasing “clothing or lyvery” for the brotherhood at
the drapers’ shops at Blackwell Hall (on or near the site of
the present Guildhall Library); the settling of the dinners,
when the member paid 2<i>s.</i>, “and for the wyf if she be att
the dyner xii<i>d.</i>” (which is not an ironmonger’s wife’s privilege
at the present time); those freemen warned to attend
the Hall and disobeying to be fined 4<i>d.</i>, and the wardens 2<i>s.</i>;
none to offer insult to their brethren; “no member to sue a
brother for debt without leave of the wardens”; apprentices
to be admitted to the fellowship “having served his tyme
well and truly”; “straungers or foreigners (that is to say,
those not already of the City) may be elected if introduced by
four creditable liverymen”; “the Wardens, once in every two
years at least, to search all manner of weights and measures
that be used in the same felashippe, and when they find any
default to levy fines at the discression of the master and
wardens”; apprentices to be enrolled at Guildhall within
the first year, and to be registered in the Company’s book;
“no person in the felashippe shall take noon apprentice excepte
he have sewertie and bond for him in Cˡⁱ sterling”; and no
apprentice to be “under 14 years of age, and for no lesse
terme than X yeres, except it be his first apprentice taken
for necessitee, and for him he shel ax licence of the wardeyns,”
and every apprentice his master shall advise to be “resonable
and honest,” and shall see that he have clean and sound
“hosyn, doblett, shirtis, and other necessaries,” ... “to
kepe hym from colde and wete,” and by no means to suffer
“his here to growe to long.” Finally, every member of the
fellowship, whether in or out of the clothing (that is to say,
liveryman or freeman), was required “to appear iiij. tymes in
the yeere at the foure principal Courts, and these iiij. Courts
ben ordeyned alway to endure to Goddes pleasir principally,
and to redresse the maters that be not wele used, and to kepe
pece and gode rewle among us,” and at these Courts all
arrearages were to be paid—the master, 12<i>d.</i>; the present or
past wardens, 8<i>d.</i>; the clothing (or liveryman), 6<i>d.</i>; and the
yeomanry (or freeman), 4<i>d.</i>; and the wardens not to see the
yeomanry decay.</p>

<p>Such then is an abstract of the earliest ordinances of the
Ironmongers. At the present time the Company consists of
a master, two wardens, the livery (all of whom comprise the
Court, and, therefore, unlike any other City Company, who
have a livery and a court of assistants as well), and the yeomanry,
or freemen generally, over which presides a warden
chosen by and from themselves at Easter, yearly. Of these
we shall speak in another chapter.</p>

<p>The ordinances were revised and approved by the Lord
Chancellor and Justices in February 1581, when the rules
were either modified or extended. The elections are set
forth; the four quarterly courts were settled, and at which the
master paid his quarterage money of 16<i>d.</i>; the warden, 12<i>d.</i>;
the liveryman, 9<i>d.</i> and the freemen, 4<i>d.</i> The apprentice
always to be of the age not exceeding twenty-four when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
his term expired. The stranger or foreigner when admitted
to pay 20<i>l.</i> The search of weights and measures to be once
a year, or oftener, in the shops of the fellowship, and false
ones destroyed, and fines of 40<i>s.</i> to the Company to be
inflicted. Other special ordinances will be alluded to in
another chapter.</p>

<p>The Company in 1549 interested themselves in the passing
of the Act against the forging of iron gads instead of gads
of steel, and six years later there are several entries relating
to the coal meterage, which the Company had to superintend
until the reign of James I. In 1557, when the rules of the
newly-founded Bridewell at Blackfriars were made, and to
which prison rogues and apprentices formerly, and of late
years unmanageable City apprentices only, have been sent by
the Chamberlain, it was specially provided in the governing
of “the nail-house” that “to you is given authority to make
sale of all such nayls as shall be made in this house, so the
same be done according to the order taken with the Company
of Ironmongers, which is, that (they giving to this
house as the people of the same may by their travail reasonably
live) shall before all men have all the nails that are
made therein, and have one month’s day of payment for the
same.” An inventory of all iron and nails, smithies, hammers,
anvils, bellows, and tools to be truly kept, &amp;c., and proper
workmen appointed to oversee the idle apprentices’ work.
In 1579 there were at Bridewell what in 1597 were called
“art masters,” or those who had charge of trade apprentices,
and among these were the naylors and pinmakers. In 1598
“Spanish needles” were made in the prison; in 1602 the
pinners’ boys numbered fourteen, and in 1604 there were to
be forty.</p>

<p>In the first year of Queen Elizabeth, 1558, the new Timber
Act received special consideration from the Company, for it
concerned the ironworks. In 1561 they took action against
one of the freemen, Clement Cornwall, about whom a complaint
was lodged for selling inferior goods at Lewes Fair,
and three years later, at the instance of the yeomanry, the
Court ordered that at fairs or elsewhere their members must
sell nails six score to the hundred, and not five score as
formerly. In 1569 the Founders’ Company fell out with the
wardens of the Ironmongers’, which was settled by the
aldermen, and ten years later three members of each Company
of Ironmongers and Grocers were ordered to attend
between the hours of 7 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> and 6 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> at the Bishop Gate
of the City, to inspect and search every person and see that
their “apparil, swords, daggers, or bucklers, wᵗ long pikes,
great ruffs or long cloakes, or carry thear swordes close under
their armes or the poyntes upward” were as by the late
proclamation provided. In 1612 the Ironmongers, Blacksmiths,
and Carpenters had many meetings, and passed special
resolutions jointly on the then serious question of the importation
of rod iron and a newly granted patent, and it is
interesting to note that the then senior warden of the Company
was the young gentleman who misbehaved himself at
Lewes Fair in 1561, as already mentioned. In 1623 the
Cutlers joined the Ironmongers, and obtained from the Corporation
the by-law that all strangers or others should be
compelled, as heretofore, to bring cutlery and iron wares to
Leadenhall to be examined. This new by-law caused the
Corporation and Companies much trouble to carry out, but
it continued a City ordinance down to the year 1665.</p>

<p>In 1636 another trouble arose. A petition to the King by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the shipwrights complained of the making of nails “of the
worst iron, of lesse weight, strength and goodnes then in
former tyme.” As the petitioners stated the deceits were
committed by “wholesale men who employed poor smiths,”
there was evidently a case of “sweating” in those days.
For this the Company were called upon to appear before the
Privy Council, where, of course, they would plead that they
had no power over the trade generally. Four years afterwards
the old complaint of the strangers, Leadenhall,
underselling, &amp;c., the Ironmongers were brought before the
Corporation, and it was ordered that the Company should,
when necessary, take possession, &amp;c. The same year, too,
the Company had to take notice of a monopoly granted by
the King to his gunfounder, of cast-iron goods, which the
Company were fortunate enough to get “called in and
overthrown.” In 1657 John Richardson, a pinmaker by
trade and Ironmonger by Company, prayed to be translated
to the newly-formed Company of Pinmakers; but as by his
copy of freedom he was to hold chiefly of the fellowship of
Ironmongers, the Court of the Company refused assent.
This custom is a peculiar one to the Ironmongers, and has
often proved a bar to progress to those desiring to join
other Guilds where promotion is more rapid.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smaller">FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OF THE IRONMONGERS’
HISTORY.—II.</span></h2>

<p>It has been asserted by some of the most violent opposers
to the Corporation of London and the City Guilds that
the Companies are part and parcel of the Corporation, that
they were incorporated for the special benefit of the trades
the names of which they are known by, that they once were,
and should still be, solely composed of such trades’ members,
and their property devoted to the artisans of such trades.
Now, with all due respect to such arguments and those who
may argue on these grounds, we must at once point out what
is always considered to be the most sensible view of the
question—that circumstances alter cases, and the merits of
each case deserve to be considered separately. Were it otherwise
there would be at once an end of our freedom and
birthright, Magna Charta, and everything else.</p>

<p>In our previous chapters we have shown that the Ironmongers’
charter makes no mention of the Guild as specially
incorporated for trade purposes or for the trade’s sole
benefit, and that the earliest by-laws simply conferred
the right of search and inspecting all weights and measures
“used in the same feloshippe,” and consequently did not
apply to the trade in general. In fact there was, and still
remains, no compulsion upon an ironmonger to join the Company,
although in ancient times, by charter-rights, he would
be compelled to become a freeman of the City, which, as we
have already stated, did not constitute him free of a Company
as well. The Ironmongers’ charter was confirmed by Philip
and Mary, June 20, 1558; by Queen Elizabeth, November 12,
1560; by James I., June 25, 1604; and by James II.,
November 19, 1687. The grant of this last-mentioned letters
patent was made to the Companies generally after the stormy
events of the previous four years, and as some reparation for
the gross injustice done to his subjects by Charles II., when,
under the power of the writ of <i>quo warranto</i>, he seized the
City charters and disfranchised the very men who had been
his best friends. This act of the “Merry Monarch,” and the
shutting up of the Exchequer, the ruin of the goldsmiths
and bankers, and the continuous oppression of the citizens by
his brother James brought about sooner than royalty
expected the destruction of the King, “the glorious Revolution
of 1688,” and the accession of William III. on
December 12 of that year, from which time, and by special
Act in his second year, the Companies have been restored to
their ancient position and privileges. And we firmly believe the
lessons then learnt by the partisans of Charles and James, and
handed down to their descendants, have not been forgotten
by those still living in the Jubilee year of Queen Victoria.
In addition to these special charters there was yet another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
grant made, which, as regards their estates, is a complete
answer to those who to-day say the Ironmongers’ property is
not their own. It is “a perpetuitie” made to them and
their successors for ever by James I., dated August 4, 1619.</p>

<p>Exactly 300 years ago the ancient City of Chester was
represented in its Mayoralty chair by an ironmonger, whose
son upset the good people of the City by retailing ironmongers’
wares, to the prejudice of the Citizens, who, by a
grant from Queen Elizabeth in 1561, had been exempted
from a duty of 2<i>s.</i> per ton upon iron imported there. And in
the same year of 1589 one Peter Newall, or Newgall, an
assistant to his father-in-law, Mr. Bavand, who appears to
have enjoyed the distinction of being “an ironmonger, a
vintner, a mercer, and a retayler of manye comodities,”
complained that David Lloyd, “a retaylinge draper,” had
“usurped the name of merchant,” for which wrongdoing the
Privy Council, the Secretary of State, the Master of the
Rolls, and all the machinery of the law was set in motion
that “the drifte of the said Lloyd shalbe ripte upp and
viewed into,” and the injury to the Citizens repaired. In
Buckingham, both in 1691 and 1706, two members of the
Blunt family were admitted into the Mercers’ Company “to
follow the trade of an ironmonger,” and both gentlemen
were subsequently Wardens of their Company. Others, too,
were admitted to follow other trades.</p>

<p>Mr. Herbert, the Guildhall Librarian, in his Historical
Essay on the City Companies, published fifty years ago, sums
up the exactions on the Guilds by the reigning powers in
these words:—“Contributions towards setting the poor to
work, towards erecting the Royal Exchange, towards
cleansing the City ditch, and towards projects of discovering
new countries; money for furnishing military and naval
armaments; for men, arms, and ammunition to protect the
City; for State and City pageants and attendances; for
provision of coal and corn, compulsory loans, State lotteries,
monopolous patents, concealments, seditious publications and
practices, and twenty other sponging expedients were among
the more prominent of the engines by which that ‘mother of
her people,’ Elizabeth, and afterwards James and Charles,
contrived to screw from the Companies their wealth.” And
J. P. Malcolm, in the second volume of his “Londinium
Redivivum,” 1803, when giving his most valuable extracts
from the Ironmongers’ books (and who speaks of Mr.
Sumner, the then clerk of the Guild’s “politeness and
attention worthy of an enlightened man,” and so totally
different to some other of the Companies’ clerks), remarks
“that specie in their hands possessed the faculty of attracting
clouds of precepts, and that, if the Company were lavish,
the Crown was always ready to receive.” Our last chapter
proves the case, but a few more entries of another kind will
confirm the views expressed.</p>

<p>In 1562 the Ironmongers were called upon to provide
without delay nineteen “good appte and talle persones to be
souldiers,” each of whom was to be provided with “corsletts
and weaponed with pykes and billes.” This demand meant
that if none of the Company’s members cared to serve, then
they were to find some other men that would, and accordingly
liverymen and yeomen had to assist out of their own
pockets to meet the charge. Four years later three more
soldiers were provided by the Company out of the 100 fully-armed
ordered away from the City for service in Ireland;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and, in 1569, no less than twenty-eight “men of honeste
behaviour” had to be found “to march against the rebells in
the north.” A few years later, in 1577, the demand
increased, for an order came for 100 “able men, apprentices,
journeymen, or others free of the City, of agilitie or honest
behaviour,” between nineteen and forty years of age, and
fully armed, for, says Malcolm in his quaint way, “the noble
art of man-killing.” The instructions issued out to these
“volunteers” are extremely curious to read, for nothing is
said in them about evolutions, advancing, retreating, or
formation into columns or squares or divisions; and, what
is more notable, each man must have been in danger every
moment of being blown into the air by his own powder!
In 1579 the Ironmongers’ proportion of the 3,000 men wanted
of the City for the defence of the realm was 110, of which
72 were to be provided with “shott, calvyʳ, flask, toche,
murryn, sword, and dagger, and a pound of powder,” and
38 with “pikes, corslett, sword, and daggʳ.” The Armada
year of 1588, and the call to arms upon that occasion will be
found fully described in the “Historical Essay,” printed in
1886; but in 1591, in order to provide the 7,000<i>l.</i> required
for manning the navy, the Ironmongers lent 344<i>l.</i>, having
two years previous received notice to have ready 1,920 lbs.
of powder. In 1643, when the Committee at Guildhall sent
a polite request to Ironmongers’ Hall desiring that fifty
barrels of gunpowder should be stored there as “a place of
safety,” the Company politely returned answer that they
could not oblige, for not only want of room, but that their
tenants next door, having Spaniards, Dutchmen, and Frenchmen
lodging in the house, might be placed in danger of no
ordinary kind.</p>

<p>In 1596 the Companies were charged with 3,500<i>l.</i> for
providing twelve ships, two pinnaces, and 1,200 men, and
the Ironmongers lent 172<i>l.</i> The next demand made for
ships or men was in the year 1639, when 1,000<i>l.</i> was raised.
Readers of history will recollect the case of John Hampden
and the “Ship Money” impost, and the Companies’ books
prove too truly the repeated extortions. The demand on the
Ironmongers’ for men alone in the forty years previous to
1600 was something like 300, besides their full equipments,
and when we reckon the money lent, the powder provided
the other calls upon their purse, it will be fully understood
that the good old times with this Company were none of the
happiest.</p>

<p>We will now mention another branch of the City Companies’
“business”—the coal and corn custom. The object
was twofold: to supply the poor in times of scarcity at a
cheap rate, and to defeat the combinations of dealers. And
yet, laudable as the custom was, it is astonishing to find
from the results that much imposition was inflicted upon
the Companies, and that the demands for storage poured in
as fast as the money precepts did. As early as 1605 the
Ironmongers agreed “to provide a shipp to fetch sea coles
from Newcastle, as other of the twelve Companies intende”;
and in 1665 (the Plague year) they laid up 255 chaldrons, all
the other Companies laying in quantities in proportion. And
here we cannot omit to mention one of the bequests made by a
worthy benefactor to the Ironmongers’ Company. Margaret
Dane, the wife of Alderman William Dane (Sheriff 1569, and
twice Master of his Company), by her will, dated in 1579,
left in trust to the Company (among other munificent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
bequests) sufficient money to provide every year 12,000
faggots to be distributed among the poor of each of the
twenty-four City Wards, to be used by such poor persons “as
fuel to keep them warm.” To this day this bequest of three
centuries ago is carried out by the company, a certain sum
being distributed to each ward. But it will hardly be
believed when we state that the opponents to the City Companies
have gone out of their way to magnify this praiseworthy
bequest into the horrible tale that this good lady
left 12,000 faggots yearly to be used for the burning of
heretics!</p>

<p>The provision of corn commenced as early as 1521, and
continued until the period of the Great Fire in 1666, when,
the Companies’ mills and granaries being destroyed, the
custom ceased, and was not afterwards renewed. In 1579
eight ironmongers were deputed to go to all the City
markets and “set the price of meale”; in 1608 the Company
was assessed at 88<i>l.</i> towards erecting the granaries at
Bridewell, and another 88<i>l.</i> the following year. Yearly provisioning
the markets at Leadenhall, at Queenhithe, and
elsewhere continued until 1649, when the Company pleaded
that, through being “disabled in their estate,” they really
were unable to meet the Lord Mayor’s demand. A complete
summary of this City corn custom will be found in Herbert’s
“History of the Companies,” vol. i., pp. 132-150.</p>

<p>We will mention a few of the “Miscellaneous” precepts
which the company were favoured with from time to time.
In 1565-66 they subscribed among themselves 100<i>l.</i> towards
“the building of the new Burse”—the first Royal Exchange.
They made loans to Yarmouth (1577), Bury St. Edmunds
(1637), and Gloucester (1643) to help those places in their
difficulties. They made a benevolence in 1604 of 40<i>s.</i> to
Messrs. Chandler &amp; Parkhurst, for having procured the
passing in Parliament of the Bankruptcy Act, “a matter
verie beneficiall to yᵉ comonwealth.” In 1631 they agreed to
subscribe 20<i>l.</i> a year for five years towards the repairing of
St. Paul’s Cathedral, and again on the rebuilding, after the
fire of London, in 1666, they, as individual members, were
benefactors. In 1694 they gave 40<i>s.</i> to a Greek presbyter of
Larissa to help him to get back to his country; in fact, such
donations frequently occur in the books. Mr. Nicholl
remarks: “Not only are the City Companies called upon to
relieve the necessities of private indigence, but there is
scarcely any public charity whatever whose petitions for aid
are not laid before them.”</p>

<p>In the beginning of the reign of James I. (1608-14) the
Company, with others, adventured in the New Virginia Plantation
Scheme, “to ease the Cittie and suburbs of a swarme
of unnecessarie inmates as a continuall cause of dearth and
famine, and the verie origenall of all plagues.” In 1609 the
King offered to the City of London the waste lands in Ulster
as another plantation scheme. This, the wisest act of His
Majesty, was accepted, and the Ironmongers (among other
City Companies) became thus possessed by actual purchase
(as shall be shown hereafter) of their Irish estate—the
Manor of Lizard. In 1625-27 the Company lent, or advanced,
money to the East India Company, and in 1633 to the Greenland
Company. It must be mentioned here that, having
subscribed to the Virginia Lottery, Captain John Smith subsequently
presented to the Company copies of four of his
books, all of which, unfortunately, are now missing. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the copies contained dedications (in MS.?) the loss is to be
much deplored.</p>

<p>We now turn to more joyful matters—pageantry. The
Ironmongers were not behind in any of these. So long ago
as 1483 ten of the Company (with proportions from other
companies), dressed in murrey-coloured coats, rode to meet
the King on his entering the City, and at the subsequent
coronation, when the Lord Mayor (Sir Edmund Shaa, goldsmith,
and Alderman of Cheap Ward, the same ward over
which the present Lord Mayor in 1889 presides) acted as
chief butler at the feast, and received from the King and Queen
the wine-cups used by them as his fee, Alderman Thomas
Breten, Ironmonger, assisted his lordship in his duties. At
most of the Royal visits and coronations, and such like festivities,
the Company, with others, always had their “standing”
and precedency, and in this respect the “place” was
much contested. A proof occurs in the history of the dispute
between the Skinners and Merchant Taylors in 1484.
Upon appeal to the Lord Mayor “for norishing of peas and
love,” he decreed that from henceforth the Skinners should
dine with the Merchant Taylors at their hall one year, and
the Merchant Taylors at Skinners’ Hall the next year,
and so yearly alternately for ever should each company have
precedence. And for 400 years has this most excellent
decree been celebrated yearly, each Company toasting in the
other’s hall their “root and branch,” and wishing them “to
flourish for ever.”</p>

<p>In 1541, when Queen Anne Bullen came from Greenwich
by water to Westminster, the Company of Ironmongers spent
no less than 9<i>l.</i> on the festivity. Their barge cost 26<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>,
and their provisions included gurnets, fresh salmon, eels,
bread and cheese, wine, claret, and a kilderkin of ale. A
reference to Nichols’s “London Pageants,” or his “Progresses”
of Queen Elizabeth and James I., will tell in full the
interesting character of these City shows, and the gorgeous
displays made by the citizens, who then, as now, never were
niggardly in their tokens of welcome. One of the most
curious of these outdoor scenes was “the setting of the
marching watch,” when 2,000 persons, apparelled in holiday
costume, with 700 lighted cressets, borne aloft, paraded the
City. A description of a visit by Henry VIII., dressed in the
costume of one of his own guards, will be found in the first
volume of Knight’s “London.” The last entry in the Ironmongers’
books is dated 1567, but an account of expenses a
quarter of a century earlier shows that 800 cresset lights cost
2<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> per 100; a dozen straw hats, 12<i>d.</i>; armourer, 6<i>s.</i> The
Company’s banquet cost 36<i>s.</i> Among the items of the feast
were: A peece of beef, 4<i>d.</i>; a breast of veel, 7<i>d.</i>; a neck
and breast of mutton, 6<i>d.</i>; a goose, 9<i>d.</i>; four rabbits, 1<i>s.</i>;
bread, 6<i>d.</i>; butter, 1½<i>d.</i>; water, 1<i>d.</i> The cook and two
assistants, 7<i>d.</i>; six gallons of wine, 7<i>s.</i>; and a gallon of
ale, 2<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Lord Mayor’s Day and the Lord Mayor’s Show was another
City festival red letter day from early times. Until the year
1752, when the Act for altering the calendar came into
force, the presentation of the Lord Mayor took place on
October 29, but since that year it has been November 9.
Sir John Norman, “Draper,” in 1452, was the first chief
magistrate to go to Westminster by water; Lord Mayor
Finnis, in 1856, the last. Most of the Lord Mayors have
had their shows, the pageantry at which has been most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
elaborate, especially during the seventeenth century. The

<p>As we have already stated, some of the early Lord Mayor’s
Shows were elaborate, and illustrative of the Company’s
trade name. They will be found chronicled in Nichols’s
“Pageants” and in Fairholt’s “Lord Mayor’s Day Pageants”
(Percy Society, 1843-45). The Guildhall Banquet tickets
during the past 100 years have been exceedingly interesting
as specimens of design and printing, the early ones being by
Bartolozzi and his school. A nearly complete set is in our
own collection, those at Guildhall, strangely enough, only
dating back some fifty years, the reason being that the show
and banquet has always been the private and personal
festival of the Lord Mayor and two Sheriffs, the former
paying a moiety of the expenses, the total generally ranging
from 2,000<i>l.</i> to 3,000<i>l.</i> It is, therefore, a vulgar error to
suppose that the Citizens and ratepayers are taxed a penny.</p>

<p>The earliest notice of the Pageantry in the Ironmongers’
books is 1566, but the most complete account is that at the
inauguration of Sir James Cambell, 1629, which was compiled
by Thomas Dekker, and entitled “London’s Tempe.”
It cost the Company 180<i>l.</i> There were six elaborately
“got up” pageants representing: for the water a sea lion
and two sea horses, and for the land an estridge, Lemnion’s
Forge, Tempe or the Field of Hapines, and Apollo’s Palace
representing the seven liberal sciences. The fourth or trade
pageant is worth quoting. It is described as “The Lemnion
Forge.” In it are Vulcan the Smith of Lemnos, with his
servants (the Cyclopes), whose names are Pyracmon,
Brontes, and Sceropes, working at the anvile. “Their habite
are wastcoates and leather aprons, their hair black and
shaggy, in knotted curles. A fire is seene in the forge,
bellowes blowing, some filing, some at other workes; thunder
and lightning on occasion. As the smithes are at worke they
singe in praise of iron, the anvile, and hammer, by the concordant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
stroakes and soundes of which Tuball Cayne became
the first inventor of musicke.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Brave iron! brave hammer! from your sound</div>
<div class="verse">The art of Musicke has her ground;</div>
<div class="verse">On the anvile thou keep’st time,</div>
<div class="verse">Thy knick-a-knock is a smithes best chyme.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In proper places sit Cupid and Jove, Vulcan and Jove
alternately singing praises, the song ending thus:—</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OF THE IRONMONGERS’
HISTORY.—III.</span></h2>

<p>The Lord Mayor’s Show of the olden time, unlike the annual
carnival of the latter half of the nineteenth century,
was in reality illustrative of the trade to which (by Company)
the chief magistrate belonged, and notwithstanding the
prejudices against pageantry at the present time, we are
staunch advocates for some annual popular display whereby
the rising generation of our great City may, like the apprentices
of old London, have visible proof that the Lord Mayor
is a reality and not invisible to his subjects, and that if
they will only put their shoulder to the wheel and emulate
Hogarth’s industrious apprentice they in time stand the best
chance of living in a big house, riding in a gilt coach, and
wearing that big gold chain which yearly makes their
appetites so keen and their eyes glisten with delight.</p>

<p>These Lord Mayor pageants of the seventeenth century
were, as we have stated, partly a show on the Thames and
partly a show in the City streets. Designed by the City poet
of the period, the descriptions were usually printed in a small
volume and circulated among the Lord Mayor’s friends and
the members of the company. Probably the largest volume
on the subject is the reprint of the Fishmongers’ pageant of
1616, edited by J. G. Nichols in 1844, a large folio with
twelve illustrations, <i>facsimiles</i> of the original drawings.
Our own copy of this work belonged to Mr. Recorder Gurney,
and has the plates beautifully hand-painted and illuminated.
And the smallest book upon so great a subject is a 32-paged
duodecimo entitled “The Lord Mayor of London: a Sketch of
the Origin, History, and Antiquity of the Office,” printed in
1860, and containing, as we believe, every fact to that date
worth knowing about the office.</p>

<p>There are two items in connection with the 1629 show
which must not be omitted. That “gentle angler,” Izaak
Walton, a City apprentice who had been admitted a member
of the Ironmongers’ Company eleven years before, on
November 12, 1618, was one of the thirty-two members of
the yeomanry who took part in the pageant. The “Sea
Lion” and the “Estridge,” after the day’s ceremony was over,
were brought in state to Ironmongers’ Hall, “to be sett upp
for the Company’s use.” We do not know how long the lion
remained so proudly exalted, but certainly not so long as the
world-renowned relic still called the “original” dagger with
which “brave Walworth knight Wat Tyler slew” in 1381,
and which, after being carried in many a Fishmongers’
pageant, rests at the present time in a glass case in Fishmongers’
Hall. The carved-wood ostrich still exists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" id="plate6">

<p class="caption">“The Blessed Virgin Mary in Glory.”</p>
<p class="caption">(<a href="#Page_55">See page 55.</a>)</p>
</div>

<p>The same year that Walton was admitted to the freedom
(1618) the Ironmongers’ pageant, exhibited a few days
previous, and at which, of course, he was unable to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
representative member, was devised by Anthony Munday.
There were three special attractions—an ironmine, an
ostrich (which eats brass and iron to help its digestion!), and
a leopard, the latter a compliment to the Lord Mayor,
whose arms bore three leopards’ heads, and whose crest was
a leopard. The cost of these was 103<i>l.</i> Some of the payments
are curious to read:—Six green (wood) men, with four
assistants, who threw up fireworks as they marched along,
cost 8<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>; two men-of-war ships cost 30<i>l.</i>; 120 chambers
or small cannon, 34<i>l.</i>, with “4 lbs. of almond comfits put in
the bullets in the cannon,” 4<i>s.</i>; banners and streamers, 36<i>l.</i>;
“a new antient staff with faire guilt head,” 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; thirty-two
trumpeters, 24<i>l.</i>; taffety sarsnet, cloth, fringe, &amp;c., 45<i>l.</i>;
“meat for the children’s breakfast,” 42<i>s.</i>; and marshalling
the show, 3<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> Last, but not least, there was such a
gigantic operation performed that it reads like a Chicago
event of to-day—“Removing the iron myne to the hall,
2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>”! The next Ironmongers’ trade pageant (1635) cost
180<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The last Lord Mayor’s Show of the seventeenth century
which the Ironmongers specially connected themselves with
was that of Sir Robert Geffery in 1685, and who subsequently
proved himself “a worthy benefactor” to the Company and
the founder of their almshouses. It was designed by
Matthew Taubman, and cost 473<i>l.</i> In his opening speech
the author reminds us:—</p>

<p>“Though poets place the Iron Age the last, it had certainly
a being and was of use before silver or gold had a value
among the ancients. To calculate the original founders we
must go further than Tubal Cain; nor is it probable the
first Cain built such a vast city without materials and
instruments proper for so great a design in opening the
quarries and diving into the stony bowels of the earth. As
the mystery of iron-working is most ancient, so is it most
useful to the State, and most profitable to the merchant and
artificer. Iron, for the universality of its use, may be called
the efficient matter of all other mysteries, being either an
ingredient or necessary instrument in all arts and professions.
Take away the use of iron, all trading must
cease.”</p>

<p>Taubman devised this “London’s Annual Triumph,” as he
called it, in four pageants. The first exhibited a pyramid,
on which was placed the Company’s founder, King Edward
the Fourth, with Victory associated with Vigilance, Courage,
and Conduct, and those four beautiful virgins, Triumph,
Honour, Peace, and Plenty; the second pageant was a sea
chariot; the third, a triumphal arch of loyalty, upon which
was exalted Fame, supported by Truth, Union, and Concord;
the fourth (or trade) pageant represented the Mountain of
Ætna casting forth its sulphurous matter, with Vulcan,
hammer in hand, at his anvil, attended by three Cyclops,
also at anvils, answering Brontes, Steropes, and Pyracmon,
who were forging thunderbolts for Jove and heads of arrows
for Cupid. Amidst all the din of music and noise of the
smiths were to be seen attendants throwing up ore from an
ironmine, at the entrance to which stood Polypheme, a
great giant, with only one eye, and that in the middle of his
forehead, who, with a huge iron bar in one hand and a sword
in the other, kept guard “to prevent all others but the Right
Worshipful the Company of Ironmongers (whose peculiar
prerogative it is) to enter.” Every figure in the pageant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
acted well his part, and Vulcan and Apollo probably took the
lead, for Vulcan, addressing the Lord Mayor, sang:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Here, sir, in iron mines of sulphurous earth,</div>
<div class="verse">Where smoak and fiery vapours take their birth,</div>
<div class="verse">We forge out thunderbolts for incenced Jove,</div>
<div class="verse">And heads of arrows for the God of Love.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Victory declaring:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Against cold ir’n no armour can prevail;</div>
<div class="verse">There’s no resistance in a coat of male.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the subsequent Guildhall banquet was sung the Company’s
song in praise of iron, and this was followed by
another specially prepared to greet the King (James the
Second), who was present.</p>

<p>It was nothing out of the way in those times for Royalty
to dine with the citizens, with whom both kings and queens
were “hale fellows well met.” The State papers and the
Royal letters prove to the hilt that in a great many instances
the citizens would have preferred their room to their company.
The best anecdote belongs to the “merry monarch”
Charles II., who, dining at Guildhall, so “hobnob’d” with
the Lord Mayor that they did not know “the other from
which.” The King, however, managed to leave without
ceremony, and was just getting into his coach in Guildhall
Yard when my Lord Mayor, discovering his loss, overtook
him, and begged “Mr. King” to return and “take t’other
bottle,” which, no doubt, he did, not forgetting a few days
later to send to my lord his little bill for the usual loan!</p>

<p>In recent years the City Companies have taken up the
question of technical education, and it cannot be denied that
in many instances they have excelled themselves in this most
praiseworthy work. If any reform is wanted, both Royalty
and Government are the last to do it, but with the City
Guilds, notwithstanding what is said against them, they have
been found to the fore when anything beneficial to the people
is required to be carried out, although in many instances
they have neither been compelled to do it nor has it been
beneficial to themselves in particular. From time to time
the Companies had subscribed largely to the charities, &amp;c., of
societies not always of their special trade; but in January,
1860, the Painters’ Stainers’ Company took the lead in quite
another direction by giving notice that in June following
they would hold an exhibition of decorative works at their
Hall in Little Trinity Lane, Cannon Street. There were
thirty-five exhibitors, and this, the first exhibition of its
kind, proving eminently successful, was held again the following
year, and has been repeated upon many occasions
since. The next Company’s announcement was that of the
Ironmongers, who held a conversazione and exhibition of ironwork
and curiosities in May, 1861, and, although this was
not a trade exhibition, but promoted by the London and
Middlesex Archæological Society, yet it brought together such
a remarkable collection as had never before been seen in a
City Company’s hall. In proof of this there is in print a
very scarce volume entitled “A Catalogue of the Antiquities
and Works of Art Exhibited at Ironmongers’ Hall, London,
in the Month of May, 1861,” edited by the well-known
Shakesperian scholar, the late G. R. French, at that time
surveyor to the Company. So laborious was the editing of
this ponderous volume, of 642 large quarto pages—for Mr.
French was compelled at last to rely on his own resources in
order to complete the book—that it was not issued until
August, 1869. The actual cost of the book will never be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
known, for Mr. French died in October, 1881, and all the
remaining copies, the drawings, the wood blocks of the 331
illustrations, and a large quantity of the original MSS.
relating to the exhibition, the book, &amp;c., had been already
dispersed. The “Catalogue,” however, will keep his memory
before the public long after everything else will have passed
away. In this volume will be found described and illustrated,
not only the charters, the plate, and other curiosities belonging
to the Ironmongers, but also those belonging to other
corporations, and the principal owners of iron and other
antiquities and curios.</p>

<p>As we have said, the exhibition was opened in May, 1861.
Over 600 persons attended the private view on Wednesday
the 8th, 420 were present on the 9th, 1,345 on the 10th, and
1,678 on the 11th and last day—in all, more than 4,000
persons, each of whom on entering signed his or her name in
a book still preserved by the Company. On the fourth day
the Prince Consort attended, and he signed his name in the
Court book. It was the regret of every one that, owing to
the immense value of the antiquities, &amp;c., the exhibition could
not be kept open longer. Since 1861 the Ironmongers have
had several other interesting meetings, and at the end of the
month of March, 1889, the Blacksmiths, by special permission,
held its first trade exhibition in the same building,
following, as they do in this laudable work, the Fishmongers’,
Plumbers’, Fanmakers’, Turners’, Carpenters’, Shipwrights’,
Horners’, Coachmakers’, and other City Guilds.</p>

<p>A most important step was taken in 1872, when the Ironmongers
joined the other City Guilds in the promotion of
technical education. Mr. Henry Grissell, an old ironmaster
and then senior warden, represented the Company at the
meetings. Speaking of this great movement, the report of
the City Livery Companies’ Commission in 1884 tells us:—“The
subject of technical education has within the last few
years been taken up by the Companies. The Clothworkers’
Company has promoted the establishment of Yorkshire
College at Leeds, where instruction is given in the manufacture
of woollen goods, and similar institutions at Bradford,
Huddersfield, and other places, the present seats of its former
trade. The City and Guilds of London Institute for the
Advancement of Technical Education has also recently been
formed. It is an association consisting of representatives of
the City of London, and of most of the more considerable
Livery Companies, and the funds which have been placed at
its disposal by the City and the Companies are very large. A
building fund of upwards of 100,000<i>l.</i> has been contributed,
and annual subscriptions have been promised
amounting to about 25,000<i>l.</i> a year. The former sum has
been, or is being, expended on a technical college in Finsbury
and a central institution in South Kensington.” When we
state that the technical education scheme is likely to cost
the companies 50,000<i>l.</i> a year, no one should say a word
against them, but rather applaud the City for having
inaugurated a grand work without Government aid or the
support of the great employers of labour in outer London.</p>

<p>The attacks made in Parliament during the past quarter
of a century against the City Companies have so far fallen
back with a crushing defeat upon the enemy. Mr. Maguire’s
Irish spoliation scheme of 1868 and 1869 ended, as it was
expected it would, in proving then (as now) that there are
many worse-managed estates there than those belonging
to the City Guilds. In 1876 and 1877 Mr. James distinguished
himself by also attacking the Companies, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
upon three occasions had the majority of the House against
his spoliation designs. Then, again, the “Royal Commission”
of 1880 has enabled our descendants to possess the finest
collection of historical details relating to the Companies it is
possible to get together, and for that alone—not for having
obtained the information at so serious an outlay to the Companies
and the public purse—historical students are truly
thankful.</p>

<p>We will now say a few words about the livery and the
yeomanry, or freemen generally, which, unlike any other
City Company, form the only two grades of membership in
the Ironmongers (all the livery forming the court); and this
exception, together with the rarity of the oldest yeoman
being considered eligible for the “Clothing,” makes this
Company in every particular as regards the term Livery
Company unique. We are very sorry it is so, because there
are many of the freemen who are not only eligible by time
service, but are in many other ways equally eligible by their
devoted interest and their ability; while the peculiar order
of the Guild prevents them being members of other Companies
where their services, &amp;c., would be more appreciated.</p>

<p><i>The Livery.</i>—The introduction of liveries into the City
Companies took place 600 years ago. The chief members
wore a gown or cloak with hood, and for distinction sake
each Company had its own colours; but we cannot learn
what the Ironmongers’ were. Edward IV.’s charter is
directed to “all the freemen of the mystery and art of Ironmongers,”
and appoints “one master and two keepers or
wardens, and the commonalty” and their successors to have
perpetual succession, with powers to frame ordinances, &amp;c.
The ordinances of 1498 (in which the warden was made
responsible in selecting the necessary cloth at the drapers)
were revised in the reign of Elizabeth, and finally approved,
as stated in our fourth chapter, in February, 1581. Four
quarterly courts were to be held, at which the livery called
“the Clothing” were to pay their quarterage, and those
neglecting to attend were to be fined 2<i>s.</i> And at these
courts the yeomanry were to appear and also pay their
quarterage. And upon the admittance of a member of the
yeomanry to the livery he was to pay 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> upon receiving
“his pattern of his lyverie.” Those not paying fines to be
sent to prison. There does not appear to be a record
officially fixing the strength of the livery. The earliest
complete list is dated 1537, when it appears that the number
was 59, at the head being William Denham (Alderman) and
Thomas Lewen (Sheriff of London). In 1570 there were
54 liverymen. In 1687, before the restoration patent of
James II., the list comprised a master, 2 wardens, 44 assistants,
and 16 liverymen—in all 60, or one more than in the
list just 150 years previous. In 1710 the list was 95, but in
1776 the court had increased to 100. In 1801 there were
97 all told; in 1828, 85; in 1833 again 98; in 1847, 82; in
1857, 99; in 1867, 84; since which time there has been a
gradual decrease, the total numbering only 48 last year.
Now this is an extraordinary decline, and we should not have
collected all these numbers had it not been that for some
years past the yeomanry, among whom are many worthy
and representative men, have been discussing their chance
of obtaining “the clothing,” seeing that “calls” to the court
are by no means regular, and when they do take place
younger men, generally sons or relatives of those already on
the court, are chosen over the heads of “antient” yeomen
equally capable, and certainly more so by long connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
with the Company, of looking after its interests, their position
in the commercial world being a guarantee that they
would serve their brethren without the “fee or reward”
about which the Royal Commission on the Companies had
so much to say. The ancient dress or costume of a liveryman
in his cap and furred robe is shown in the Leather-sellers’
charter facsimiles in the magnificent quarto work
on that Guild, edited by the late W. H. Black, for the Company
in 1871. From time to time many ordinances were
made about the citizens’ dress, special reprimands to the
livery being administered in 1619 and 1677 for not appearing
in their gowns; and in 1698 the Corporation issued an
order that in future no one should join as a liveryman one of
the twelve Companies unless he had an estate of 1,000<i>l.</i>, or
one of the minor Guilds under 500<i>l.</i> By an order passed in
1790 no servant is eligible for election on the livery. In
1627 a very curious dispute arose between Humphrey Hook,
then residing at Bristol, where he had served municipal
offices, and the court, they calling upon him to be their
warden, he having been a freeman twenty-four years. The
Company appears to have won the case.</p>

<p><i>The Yeomanry</i> are the freemen of the Company generally,
and about 300 in number. Although not of the “Clothing”
(livery) a yeoman was described by an authority in 1759 as
being of military origin, and in many respects equal to an
esquire, the former fighting with arrows and bows made of
yew tree, the latter carrying for distinction and defence a
shield. In the ordinances of 1581 it was laid down that the
yeomanry should pay their quarterage of 4<i>d.</i> a quarter, and
that the wardens of the livery should, when necessary, help
the “wardens of the yeomanry”; the four quarter-days are
specially named as July 25, or St. James’ day, October 18,
being St. Luke’s day, New Year’s day, and the Wednesday
in Easter week, on which last-named day the new warden
of the yeomanry should be elected for two years, there
having been two wardens allowed by petition in 1497. All
members failing to appear on these days were fined. It was
also decreed that two suppers should be kept yearly at the
hall, for which the wardens were allowed 33<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> Mr.
Nicholl, the Company’s historian, states that the wardens of
the yeomanry stand in the same position to their body as the
wardens of the livery do; but of late years, their duties
having declined, only one warden now represents the freemen.
The quarterage, too, of 16<i>d.</i> per annum has for many years
past ceased to be collected, and the two meetings and
suppers at the hall, which formerly took place on election
day and St. Luke’s day (by and under the authority of the
ancient ordinances of 1581, confirmed by the Lord Chancellor
in 1590, assisted by the will in 1653 of “a worthy
benefactor,” none other than the clerk of the Company,
Ralph Handson, and finally approved by the Charity Trustees
in 1876), were in the year 1830 discontinued, and two
dinners appointed to take place at the hall in their stead.
At these meetings and festivals, which are proved to be no
unimportant rights, the senior warden of the livery presides,
drinking health and prosperity to the yeomanry “root and
branch, and may they flourish for ever”; their warden replying,
and desiring his brethren in return to drink to the
health of the senior warden. These are the only occasions
when the members have the opportunity and pleasure of
meeting in a body, and may the ancient custom—which by
special ordinances became the freemen’s right—long continue
is a wish echoed by the whole Company. Formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the bread and cheese and ale repast was obtained from the
old King’s Head Tavern opposite the hall in Fenchurch
Street, and it was within the walls of the New London
Tavern, erected on its site, that the warden of the yeomanry
for the year 1888 held the St. Luke’s day meeting, and by
discoursing to his brethren upon the history and antiquity
of the Company, and exhibiting a number of curiosities
relating to the Ironmongers, not only brought together a
most enthusiastic audience, but for the first time in the
recollection of the yeomanry made them feel interested in
their Guild, and to pass a resolution never to permit the
opportunity of meeting twice a year (by virtue of the old
ordinance) to lapse in the future.</p>

<p>The freedom of the Ironmongers’ Company is obtainable
by patrimony (as children of freemen, for there have been
free women admitted), servitude (as apprentices to freemen),
and redemption (by payment of one hundred guineas, or
honorary presentation); but, curious to relate, although
there are members of the Company “learned in the law” at
the present time (as freemen by patrimony), no attorney is
eligible for election by redemption. By ordinance dated
1657 no person is to change the copy of his freedom, and by
an order of Court made November 21, 1878, “no person who
is free of any other Company can be admitted to the freedom
of the Ironmongers’ Company, nor can he become free of
another Company after being admitted to the freedom of
this Company.” This order necessarily makes the Ironmongers
a select body corporate, and unlike the other Companies
of the City. Upon being elected freeman the
member makes a declaration accordingly, and when elected
warden he takes the warden’s oath to look after the Company’s
welfare during his term of office. The beadle of the
Company half-yearly sends out the notices: “You are
desired by the warden of the yeomanry to meet at Ironmongers’
Hall” (on the day of election, or St. Luke’s) “when
a court will be holden in the usual manner.” At this court
the warden presides and signs the freemen’s book, as do
also such members who may be present. The beadle, having
previously written to those of the yeomanry eligible for
office of warden, submits the replies to the court. The
election is entirely by their own vote, and selected from
those present; and we believe for the first time in 1881,
when Mr. F. W. Pellatt was chosen. The warden of the
following year (Mr. Alfred Marshall, C.E.) was re-elected in
1883, he having taken an active part in the freemen’s
interest; and at the election in 1888 (the Armada Tercentenary
celebration year) the warden chosen was the
author of the “Historical Essay” upon the Spanish Armada,
who, being a member of the Plymouth and London committees,
was selected in commemoration of the Company’s
zeal at the time of the threatened invasion 300 years previous.
At the yeomanry meeting at Easter, 1883, a special
vote of condolence with the family was recorded in the
minute-book upon the decease of “its much respected clerk,
Simon Adams Beck, Esq., who for the long period of nearly
fifty years so ably discharged the duties of his very important
office.” The death of Mr. Beck, who was at one time
Governor of the Gas Light and Coke Company—the district
in which the works are situated being now known as Beckton—was
a sad loss to every member of the Ironmongers’ Company.
His portrait appropriately hangs close to that of Mr.
John Nicholl, the Company’s historian, in the court-room at
the hall.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE APPRENTICES, THE HALL, AND THE IRISH
ESTATE.</span></h2>

<p>The London apprentice of the olden time was as different
a personage to the ’prentice lad of to-day as the streets
of the City are now unlike the thoroughfares of two or three
centuries ago. The ancient Guild ordinances relating to
apprentices prove that they were considered a most important
part of the establishment of a citizen, and this is
not to be wondered at when we consider that not only the
trade of his master, but the trade of London, depended
entirely upon the skilled artisan and craftsman’s ability,
without which all the money-bags of the merchant were of
little use. We could fill a volume with the history and
anecdotes of the apprentice, but must content ourselves by
giving a brief summary only; and the notes that we do give
will show that our apprentices were not unworthy of the
City, notwithstanding they were never backward in crying
“Clubs! clubs!” and eager for the fray. In every festival,
on the “high days and holidays” of civic life, at the
marching watch or a Lord Mayor’s Show, at “going a
Maying” to Shooters’ Hill, and archery practice in Finsbury
Fields, the apprentice was an expected visitant. As he
existed in the days of James I., Sir Walter Scott, in his
“Fortunes of Nigel,” conveys to us a presentable and true
picture.</p>

<p>Since the year 1662, no sooner was a boy aged fourteen
than a master was found, and to him he was “bound” to
serve, to follow his master’s trade, and to learn it until the age of
twenty-one, when, having proved a good apprentice, he was
admitted to the freedom of the Company to which such
master belonged. Sometimes his master in the meantime
died, and that necessitated his being “turned over” to
another employer. If the boy misbehaved himself, then the
Company and the Chamberlain took him in hand, and, if
incorrigible, to Bridewell he was sent. It neither benefited
the Corporation, the Company, nor the master to take too
severe measures, and in recent years the cases have been few
where correction has been administered, although to our
minds it should have been oftener; and instances, too, have
occurred where the master ought to have paid the penalty as
well.</p>

<p class="caption">(<a href="#Page_55">See page 55.</a>)</p>
</div>

<p>The earliest enrolment of a City apprentice was in the
reign of Edward II., or five centuries and a half ago. There
is a curious case recorded in the Guildhall Letter-book II,
folio 42, of the year 1376, when William Grendone, <i>alias</i>
Credelle, a scrivener, was sent to Newgate and fined for
making a false indenture between William Ayllesham, a
goldsmith, and Nicholas, the son of William Flourman. The
indenture was for nine years, and the surety, instead of the
father of the boy, was named as “the Cross at the North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Door.” This cross—Broken Cross, or the Stone Cross—was
at the north door of St. Paul’s, and, having been erected in
the reign of Henry III., remained there until 1390, and in
those superstitious ages any transaction there was, as a rule,
considered binding. Each cross in the City had certain
stalls, or stands, or stations, and these from time to time
were let to persons who thus became Stationers, and in
course of time left these stations at the Cross, and took up
their position in and about Paternoster Row.</p>

<p>The Ironmongers’ ordinance for the year 1498 (confirmed
by the Judges February 16, 1581) specially
mentions the apprentice, as we have shown in our fourth
chapter. The housing, the clothing, and the general welfare
of the boy were fully set down, even to the command that
the master “shall not suffre his (the apprentice’s) here to
growe to long!” Again, “Every maister is sworne at the
Guyldehall to make his prentice free wᵗʰout any cost or
charge to the prentice”—a custom, we regret to say, long
ago forgotten; and a century and a half after the making
of the ordinance it was further ordered that any master
putting in an appearance with the boy at the hall “before he
have orderly cutt and barbed his hayre to the liking of the
Mʳ and Wardens of the Company” was to be fined twenty
shillings. One of the best City ordinances was that preventing
the early marrying of artisans, in 1556—a custom
which had produced “povertie, penurie, and lacke of livyng.”
The Act recites:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>That by reason of the over hastie marriges and over some setting up of
housholdes of and by the youth and young folkes of the sayde citie wᶜʰ
hath comonly used and yet do, to marry themselves as sone as ever thay
come oute of theyr apprenticehode be thaye never so young and unskilful,
yea and often tymes many of them so poore that they scantly have of
theire proper goodeyes wherewith to buye theire marriage apparel, and
to furnish ther houses with implements and other thinges necessary for
the exercise of ther of ther occupacons whereby they should be able to sustayne
themselves and theire family;</p>

</div>

<p>therefore, for the remedy it was ordered that all apprentices
in future should not be made free until the age of
twenty-four, at which age his apprenticeship is to expire,
and any master violating the order to pay a fine of 20<i>l.</i> It
is a curious coincidence, too, that in the original rules, dated
September, 1557, for the government of “the House of
Bridewell,” which hospital the City had recently obtained
from Edward VI., there is a special ordinance relating to the
oversight of “the Nail House”:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Now for the setting on work of the idle; it shall be very requisite that
with as much speed, and as conveniently as yᵉ may, that yᵉ increase the
number of apprentices being taught in the said faculty and discharge the
number of journeymen, to the intent the same apprentices being themselves
perfect and absolute therein may train and teach such of our poor
children or other needy people as hereafter we shall call out of the hateful
life of idleness.</p>

</div>

<p>As already stated, the overseers, artmasters, taskmasters,
workmasters, or artificers, for the foremen of the Bridewell
shops, where the boys were taught clothworking, weaving,
pinmaking, &amp;c., were so called, had under their charge sometimes
150, and as many as 250. Two of the hospital minute
entries tell us:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1602, Oct. 21.—Richard Brookes, fustian weaver, engages to take during
seven years next ensuing 40 vagrant boyes and wenches of this city as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
apprentices to keep in diett, apparell, washing and wringing: the said
R. Brookes to receive with every of the said children at their coming clean
apparell and 10<i>l.</i> yearly.</p>

<p>1604, February 20.—Francis Ackland, pinmaker, engages to take
40 vagrant boys as apprentices.</p>

</div>

<p>And in 1606 the minute-book reports the order that the
names of all proposed apprentices brought into the House of
Bridewell shall be registered, as also the master’s name.
During the last century the apprentices in the house
gradually declined, for in 1708 there were 140, in 1768 only
60, in 1789 only 36, and in 1791 only 26, illustrating but too
forcibly the change in the times. It is probably not generally
known that in the olden time the Bridewell boys upon the
ringing of the fire-bell by the beadle used to drop their tools
and start off to the fire, wherever it was situate in the
metropolis. The result was:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>They were active, to be sure, and serviceable; but what were the consequences
to themselves? They were thrown among all those profligates
which a fire collects in the streets. They got liquor, they got money, and
frequently roamed about the town all night without controul. The
masters lost the benefit of the next day’s labour; and not seldom boys
were hurt, and for a long time disabled from working. It is about
20 years since this very pernicious practice was restrained.</p>

</div>

<p>By the above quotations, written in 1798, we have shown
that Bridewell was not only a House of Correction for City
vagrants, but was from its foundation a real workhouse
and artisans’ workshop. Many ignorant and misinformed
persons have before now gone out of their way to abuse this
institution, and declare that it never was put to the use the
royal founder intended. We could multiply our proofs that
Bridewell always was a useful house until Government, more
than a century ago, meddled with the City management,
and spoilt this and Christ’s Hospital as well.</p>

<p>Another ancient ordinance of the City is dated 1582, when
every freeman was charged to take such steps necessary to
prevent, and not to suffer under any circumstances, “servants,
apprentices, journemen, or children, to repare or goe
to annye playes, peices or enterludes, either wiᵗʰn the Citie
or suburbs,” under the severe pains and penalties “at the
discretion of me and my brethren.” Exactly a century later,
on August 9, 1682, some 2,000 apprentices of London, who
had taken active steps in the address to Charles II. for the
support of the institution, were feasted in Merchant Taylors’
Hall, the king specially sending them two fat bucks for the
occasion.</p>

<p>The following is a copy of an original apprenticeship
indenture, dated 1676. It is printed on vellum, 7 by 4 inches
in size, the names and date being the only portions written:—</p>

</div>

<p>By the Act of Common Council, passed March, 1889,
apprentices can now be bound for four years instead of seven,
and instead of the master being compelled (as of old) to
make the apprentice an indoor servant, he is to pay wages
sufficient to keep the boy in food, clothing, &amp;c., elsewhere, as
may be arranged. This term of four years also entitles the
apprentice to his freedom if the bindings are to citizens, and
effected by the Chamberlain and the Companies. The Ironmongers
so long ago as January, 1863, had (when desired)
adopted the five years’ term, but then, while it gave the boy
the Company’s freedom, it did not confer that of the City.
Thus, at last, in this official four years’ term, we have arrived
at a most satisfactory settlement of a long and often heart-burning
grievance.</p>

<p>The Ironmongers’ Hall, where the bindings take place and
the Company’s business transacted, is situated in Fenchurch
Street, one house westward of Billiter Street. The original
ground upon which the premises stand was purchased by
nineteen ironmongers, members of the ancient Guild, in
October, 1457, and the original purchase deeds still exist to
prove that the site is the private property of the descendants
of those nineteen brethren of the Guild—if there is really
any law extant that freehold property belongs to the “root
and branch” of a true-born Englishman. The Hall is mentioned
in 1479 as being in the parish of All Hallows Staining,
in the Ward of Aldgate. Between the parochial authorities
and the Company long existed a dispute upon the burning
question of tithes, until some twenty years ago it reached
the crisis. A warrant was issued, and four of the candelabra
and two of the loving cups were “in a friendly way,” in order
to test the case, placed on a table in the Hall and momentarily
seized by the official, and as quickly restored upon the
usual bonds being given for the superior Court’s decision. A
few years before—in 1862—some beautiful specimens of
ornamental ironwork, which the company had erected in the
Corporation pew in the church as rests for the sword and
mace, suddenly disappeared, but upon question raised as
suddenly returned. There is a funny entry in the church-wardens’
accounts of this parish for the year 1494: “Payd for
a kylcherkyn of good ale, which was drunkyn in the Yrynmongers’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Hall, all chargis born xij<i>s.</i> ij<i>d.</i>” We should like to
know what brought about this merry-making 400 years ago.
Could it have been “a parochial settlement” of the dispute
of 1479?</p>

<p>In Aggas’s map of the City, of the reign of Elizabeth,
Ironmongers’ Hall is depicted as a range of buildings (among
which was the clerk’s residence). There was no entrance
from Fenchurch Street, but only through a long garden
having entry from Leadenhall Street. That there was a
garden to the Hall is certain, because in the records, about
the year 1540, there are numerous interesting entries similar
to these:—</p>

<table summary="Entries from the records">

  </tr>
</table>

<p>The first Hall remained until 1585, when, being found
“ruinous and in greate decay,” it was rebuilt, and a kitchen
erected. The cost was large—something like 600<i>l.</i>—but the
ground covered was somewhat extensive. Tapestry was
ordered for the Hall in 1590, and in 1629 further additions
were made. In 1686 new sundials were erected, and in 1701
a new wall was put up to prevent the persons in the tavern
next door looking across the Company’s garden into the
private apartments of the Company. In 1707 a mulberry
tree was planted in the garden, and in 1719 some new lime
trees, so that the Ironmongers’ garden was quite a rural
retreat, and like the Drapers’ garden, which has only of late
years been covered over by bricks and mortar.</p>

<p>The second Ironmongers’ Hall was not burnt in the great
fire of 1666, although it was surrounded by the destructive
demon. A certain William Christmas, shipwright, did some
good service to the Company upon the occasion, so that in
March, 1667, he received a gratuity. In 1677 the Corporation
ordered all public buildings to keep leather buckets,
hand-squirts, &amp;c., to be ready in case of fire, and the Ironmongers
provided themselves with thirty buckets, one engine,
six pickaxes, three ladders, and two squirts, the latter being
of brass, 3 feet long and 9 inches diameter. To this day
may be seen some, if not the, buckets, hanging in the vestibule
of the Hall. In 1699 the music-room was repaired; in
1707 a lion and unicorn was put up in the court-room.</p>

<p>The third, and present, Ironmongers’ Hall was erected
from the designs of T. Holden, and at a cost of about 5,000<i>l.</i>,
about 1748. It was not completed until 1750, when, on
February 13 that year, a ball was given at the opening, and
a hogshead of port wine, half a chest of oranges, and other
good things were consumed at the feast. A full description
of the Hall and its interesting contents will be found in
Malcolm’s “Londinium Redivivum,” vol. ii. 1803, pp. 32-62.
The Hall was repaired in 1817, and in 1827 a light corridor
connecting the grand staircase with the drawing-room was
erected, and two years later the four handsome columns and
pilasters were put up in the drawing-room. Just about a
century after the erection of the present Hall it underwent
an entire redecoration, and was reopened once more with a
ball on June 8, 1847. The banqueting-room is 70 feet long
and 29 feet wide. A carved panelled dado, 8 feet high, is
carried round the room, having in the upper compartments
the arms in proper colours of the past masters from the
recognised foundation in 1351. The windows, as seen from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the street, are curious as presenting seven different styles,
and only equalled, we believe, by a house in Berkeley Square,
where, out of eleven windows, seven are of different kinds.
Mr. Nicholl gives a full description of the Hall and its contents
as existing in 1866 in his “Some Account,” pp. 421-467.
The portraits of eminent members hang on the walls of the
banqueting-room and in the court-room, two of the latest in
the latter room being those of Mr. John Nicholl, F.S.A., the
Company’s historian, and Mr. S. Adams Beck, who for nearly
fifty years was the clerk and sincere friend of the Company,
as mentioned in our last chapter.</p>

<p>From Ironmongers’ Hall were conducted the last remains
of many a notable member or citizen in the olden time. The
funeral pall or hearse cloth used on these occasions was the
gift of John Gyva, ironmonger, in 1515, and Elizabeth, his
wife. It is of crimson velvet and cloth of gold tissue, and is
described and illustrated at pages 454-7 of Mr. French’s
“Catalogue.” Notes of the sixteenth century funerals are
given in “The Diary of Henry Machyn” (Camden Society),
1848. In the “Diary of Samuel Pepys” he tells us of the
funeral from the Hall in November, 1662, of Sir Richard
Stayner, where “good rings” were distributed and the
mourners had “a four-horse coach,” in which he by mistake
took a place.</p>

<p>There have been many meetings at the Hall, some of
national and others of great civic interest, especially in the
making free and entertainments to distinguished men like
Lords Hood and Exmouth. In 1694 the Company let the
Hall for a lottery, which was called “the best and fairest
chance at last,” and five years later the whole of the old
armour then standing in and about the premises was sold to
Mr. Thomas Saunders for eight guineas, “the musketts
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> apiece!” It is not generally known that the national
anthem of “God Save the King,” so repeatedly sung at the
old City feasts and all over the world, was the composition
of Dr. John Bull, who, with the children of the King’s
Chapel, sung and played it before James I. and Prince
Henry at the Merchant Taylors’ Hall feast, July 16, 1607. In
Ironmongers’ Hall have dined Dr. Livingstone, Admiral
Dawes, and Sir Garnet Wolseley, the latter just before leaving
England for the Gold Coast. An interesting article, entitled
“Banqueting with the Ironmongers,” and giving a good
picture of these modern entertainments, appeared in the
<i>City Press</i>, August 21, 1875. The Company’s plate is not so
extensive as that possessed by some of the City Guilds. The
collection will be found described by Mr. French in his
“Catalogue,” pp. 616-624. There are two mazer bowls
(thirteenth to sixteenth century drinking-vessels), of which
only fifty are supposed to be extant, and therefore curious
and interesting. They are described by Mr. St. John Hope
in “Archæologia,” vol. 50, 1887, pp. 129-193. In the old
views of the exterior of the Hall are shown the houses on the
east side adjoining Billiter Street. These were pulled down
and rebuilt some twenty years ago. Finally, in bringing our
description of the Hall to a close, we cannot forbear mentioning
a curious fact. In the first report of the City Livery
Companies’ Commission, 1884, p. 36, there is a list given of
all the existing halls of the City Guilds, thirty-four in
number, and yet the Ironmongers’ (one of the twelve) has
been omitted!</p>

<p>We shall conclude this chapter by noticing the Irish estate
of the Ironmongers’ Company, called “The Manor of Lizard,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
about seven miles from Coleraine, and skirting the river
Bann, in the province of Ulster, the total area of which is
between 12,000 and 13,000 acres, occupied as 550 holdings,
with a population of about 2,800 persons all told. The net
receipts from rents come to about 4,000<i>l.</i> a year. The estate
is scattered over five parishes, and until recent years has
been a great anxiety to the Company, who, having, like other
Guilds, in former times let their lands as a whole to certain
responsible persons, receiving a yearly rent, found out too
late then that these persons, some of whom were resident,
grossly neglected the well-being of both the property and the
people. In 1766 the Company leased the estate to Josias du
Pre, Esq., for sixty-one years and three lives. In 1813 he
sold the remainder of his lease to the Beresford family. The
last life mentioned in the lease was that of the Bishop of
Meath, who died in his eighty-third year in 1840. The
Hon. the Irish Society reported that year:—“The present
holders seem only to have used the property for the purpose
of making the most of it during the term of their lease,”
consequently when the Company took possession they found
it no easy matter to put the estate in that order which they
so long desired to do. Through their energetic agents they
have at last succeeded, after terribly uphill work, and we
believe the tenantry now find out the truth of the Irish
Society’s report in 1838, which stated, “This estate upon the
death of the Bishop of Meath passes into the hands of the
Company, and we have no doubt that it will prove a source
of much happiness to the tenantry when they shall be placed
under the immediate superintendence of that body.”</p>

<p>The origin of the purchase of this estate arose through the
rebellion in Ireland, in the reign of Elizabeth, when the
O’Neills and the O’Dohertys were in the possession of the
province of Ulster. In order to suppress the revolt the army
was sent over in 1566, and encamped in Derry County.
The lands were subsequently confiscated, and when James I.
came to the throne he found them such a source of trouble
that he or his Ministers devised the scheme of selling the
whole property, being, as we have said, confiscated
from traitors to the Crown. The King also instituted the
order of Baronets to such persons who would pay towards
the charges of the reclamation of the waste lands and the
new plantation, and peopling with Protestants the North of
Ireland, and that is why the red hand of Ulster will be
found in a baronet’s coat of arms. After much trouble the
City of London were offered the Irish estates, which the
Companies jointly purchased for 40,000<i>l.</i> This sum was
subscribed by fifty-five of the Guilds, being the twelve great
and forty-three minor Companies. The great ones were to
manage for the lesser, the Ironmongers being associated
with the Brewers, Scriveners, Coopers, Pewterers, Barbers,
Surgeons, and Carpenters, paying 3,333<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> as their
share, calling their portion the Manor of Lizard, from the
crest of their arms. “This manor was created by the Irish
Society in October, 1618, and was conveyed to the Ironmongers’
on November 7 following, to the only use and
behoof of the said Company, their successors, and assigns
for ever.” In May, 1613, the Coopers’ Company’s share was
taken over by the Corporation of London, and the Irish
Society of the City of London, incorporated by royal charter
March 29, 1613, was made a body corporate to carry out the
plantation of the City and County of Londonderry, which
cost them from first to last before completed nearly 100,000<i>l.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
To this day the citizens of London annually visit Ireland,
the last visit in 1888 being more than usually important, as
the two-hundredth anniversary of the memorable siege of
Derry, now Londonderry, in 1688, about which so much has
been written and said. The following works may be consulted
as giving true details of the plantation scheme, one
of, if not the wisest of, the schemes of the first King James:—</p>

<span class="smaller">THE IRONMONGERS’ CHARITIES AND CHARITABLE
IRONMONGERS.</span></h2>

<p>Citizenship is the birthright of every man, but it is not
every man who is worthy of the name of citizen. What
makes the honourable distinction all the more valuable
is when “a citizen of no mean city,” and the true representative
of “a nation of shopkeepers,” so truly values his rights
and privileges as to be ever ready to come forward when
occasion requires to protect it from the ignorance and contamination
of those whose only design must be to overthrow
its virtues for the sake of personal gains. It was Lord
Chancellor Selborne who some years ago publicly declared
that his ancestors for four generations had been connected
with one of the City Guilds, and he had never been ashamed
of anything either of those ancestors had done, and never
regretted his own connection with the City or its Companies.
And another eminent man of earlier days most emphatically
declared, “I would rather be born of the basest and meanest
of mankind, and rise to fame and distinction by my own
exertions, than that, being born of noble ancestry and high
degree, I should bring disgrace on an exalted name, and
cross with a bar sinister the proud escutcheon of my father’s
house.”</p>

<p>To the humble traders of old London their richer brethren
left their trusts, their charities, and their blessings. Their
estates had been obtained by hard work and hard-earned
money in a great many instances, and having been associated
with the zealous and careful men of their own Guilds they
left to them the carrying out of the designs expressed in
their wills. No one would have left to a Government
department such a trust then, and no one will do so now.</p>

<p>The Government inspector, in his evidence before the
Companies Commission, declared that he considered William
Thwaytes’ bequest of 20,000<i>l.</i> “to make the Society comfortable”—and
that Society was the Clothworkers’ Company, to
which he belonged some half a century ago—really meant
“to make the traders comfortable”! Or that every clothworker
in the kingdom—shall we say the world?—ought to
participate. On the same principle, if a workman in a shop
left “to the workmen in the shop” 5<i>l.</i>, every shop in that
trade should have its share. Pray what would be the value
of the bequest?</p>

<p>The City Companies, as we have shown in the history of
the Ironmongers, had a terribly uphill battle to fight with
early monarchy. Whenever there was a chance to rob the
citizens, down pounced the Government or Royalty.
Henry VIII. commenced by dissolving the religious houses,
and the good King Edward VI. seized the properties left to
the Companies by the wills of benefactors on the plea that
they were for superstitious uses. Having taken possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
he was glad enough to sell the property back to them, so
that he made a very profitable business of the transaction.
The result of this “clever” and “sharp” practice was that
the Ironmongers had to sell their private property to buy
back the trust estate. Having done this, is it not creditable
to a City Company to be still administering that trust of which
the King himself had originally deprived them?</p>

<p>Coming down to more modern times, Thomas Betton,
Hoxton Square, Shoreditch, left the Ironmongers’ Company,
in 1723, the residue of his estate for the purpose of redeeming
slaves in Barbary. Other notable citizens had done a
similar good deed before then, for so long previous as 1641
Roger Abdy, merchant, had left 120<i>l.</i> “for or towards the
ransoming and redeeming of sixe poore English Protestant
captives out of the bondage and slavery of the Turks.”
Thomas Betton’s bequest was a noble one, for just about the
date of it all the world was suffering from the terrors of
slavery. Between 1734 and 1825 the Company appears to
have paid away in redemption money something like 21,000<i>l.</i>,
or as much as the whole estate had been originally worth,
but the Ironmongers, having been good trustees, had “improved”
the estate, and the result was that after Lord
Exmouth’s great victory, no more slaves being likely to be
redeemable, and there being a large balance at the bank, the
Company desired to utilise the surplus for the benefit of charity,
reserving a certain sum per annum for future redemptions
and contingencies. This was serious, so down came the
Government and popped the whole into Chancery. The
Company believed they were right, and did not want the interference;
but they had to fight against the Crown, and from
1829 to 1845 did the battle last. Several thousands of
pounds did Government law cost the charity, but that
the Company was right is evident, because the highest
tribunal, the House of Lords, decided that what the Company
had proposed so many years before should now be carried out—bequests
to the poor of the company and to every national
school in the kingdom.</p>

<p>The Ironmongers’ charities are not so extensive as many of
the other City Guilds’, but they represent a variety of really
good and seasonable benefactions. Among these are two
almshouse foundations (Geffery and Lewen), scholarships to
schools and exhibitions to universities, a small free school in
Cornwall, the poor of the City wards, loans to poor young
freemen to help them on in life, bequests to hospitals, to
poor maids upon their marriage, to poor prisoners in debt, to
the poor freemen and their widows, to poor ministers and
clergy, to the national schools of the kingdom, &amp;c. The
charity trusts amount to about 12,000<i>l.</i> a year, half of which,
being from rents, have of late years fluctuated. The Company
does not possess any ecclesiastical patronage, except
the appointment of a chaplain, who is also the minister to
the almshouse poor. There was a priest of the company 400
years ago, but the present chaplain, the Rev. H. M. Baker, is
the fourteenth since 1715, when the first appointment to the
almshouses in the Kingsland Road was made.</p>

<p>Through the changes of the times and the “compulsory”
sales by Act of Parliament for modern improvements, some
of the old property has changed hands and new property has
been purchased. This has been specially the case under the
Geffery and Betton trusts, and round about East and West
Ham and the Isle of Dogs. The Company now possesses
houses and premises in Old Street, St. Luke’s (Mitchell),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Basinghall Street, Philpot Lane, and Fleet Street. It also
possesses the site of the famous New Park Street Chapel,
Southwark, where the Rev. C. H. Spurgeon first preached
when he came to London; also, farms in the counties of
Bucks, Essex, and Surrey. When in the good old times—so
says a newspaper in July, 1769—the Company went on
tour to view their Essex estate, they “held their annual feast
at the Devil’s House” (now Duval’s House), near East Ham,
a house of entertainment at that date. The sign of the
house is suggestive to the disciples of St. Dunstan. In recent
years two great districts have grown up in and around East and
West Ham—Beckton, which takes its name from the worthy
clerk of the Company (S. Adams Beck), who died in 1883,
and Silvertown, from a recent Master of the Ironmongers’
Company (S. W. Silver), who has proved most energetic in
promoting the Company’s welfare. One word more about
the old estates. The great fire of London of 1666 burnt
down nearly all the City property of the Companies, and the
loss to the Ironmongers was serious. Fortunately, the Hall
was saved.</p>

<p>Charitable Ironmongers, whether we view them as donors
of land, of houses, of plate, or other things, or for the time
they have given towards promoting the welfare of the Company,
have been in many ways worthy benefactors to the City
and the citizens. We have been curious in one inquiry—to
what extent the donations of some classes of plate have been
made, and we find that in the 400 years ending 1865
“brother” Ironmongers have given twenty-nine silver gilt
cups and covers, many very large and valuable, seventeen
basins and ewers, and seven salts; besides many other
descriptions of plate, such as silver spoons, ornaments,
candlesticks, and the like. Of course, the Company does not
possess all the valuables now. Our former Monarchy, who
had the citizens’ welfare so much at heart, took good care (as
we have already shown) not to allow these valuables to
remain too long in the hands of “the City Fathers,” and so
to-day the Ironmongers have but a small collection of plate.
When the charitable Ironmongers left these cups for their
brethren “to make themselves comfortable,” whether at a
dinner or other feast, they never thought that their radically-inclined
descendants would object to the good old English
greeting: “The Master and Wardens drink to you in a loving
cup, and bid you all a hearty welcome.”</p>

<p>Eminent Ironmongers, by their portraits, still adorn the
Ironmongers’ Hall. Thirteen are in the banqueting-room,
and eight in the court-room. Armorial shields round the
Hall give us the names of our worthy Masters from the
earliest times, while there are two statues of great interest,
Edward IV., the founder, and Lord Mayor Beckford—this
latter being in a niche on the grand staircase.</p>

<p>Abstracts of most of the Ironmongers’ wills are in our
collection, and the series is most curious. We cannot do
justice to the subject now, but some time we hope to give
some interesting details. One, however, is worth quoting,
and that is of Alderman Richard Chamberlin, 1567. He was
a good benefactor, he remembered the poor, he gave the
Company 50<i>l.</i> “to helpe them oute of debte,” he left 10<i>l.</i> for
“a dynner at oure halle,” desiring the members’ wives should
be present, and he then put down on paper, “I praye God
make us merye in Heaven!”</p>

<p>We will now, in alphabetical arrangement, give a few of
the names of those Ironmongers worth remembering. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
do not profess to give a complete list, for such would form a
volume by itself, so numerous are they, and so many notes do
we possess about them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bate</span>, John, 1500, and Felys his wife, gave to the Company
a cup and other things, “ther with to do God and us worship,
and not to be solde while they will last.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beckford</span>, William, Alderman, and Lord Mayor 1762 and
1770, when he died; was made free of the Company 1752,
was born in Jamaica, his father being Peter Beckford,
Speaker in the Assembly. The Lord Mayor made himself
famous by his celebrated speech to George III., as engraved
on the monument in Guildhall. Another statue, formerly at
Fonthill, was presented to the company by his son William
in 1833. See pedigrees and other details in Britton and
Rutter’s two descriptions of Fonthill, Wilts. Richard,
brother of the Lord Mayor, was also Alderman and M.P., but
he was a member of the Clothworkers’ Company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betton</span>, Thomas, a Turkey merchant, admitted to the
freedom by redemption 1696, lived in Hoxton Square; will
dated 1723. He died 1724; buried in the Ironmongers’
Almshouse Grounds, Kingsland Road. Portrait presented
to the Company in 1728. Gave the residue of his estate for
the redemption of slaves in Barbary (as already noted).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blundell</span>, Peter, although not an Ironmonger, but from
a poor errand boy had grown to be a rich clothier, and one
of “the worthies of Devon” (Prince), and “a man very Godly
and Christianly disposed all his life time” (Stow), left
charities to the extent of about 40,000<i>l.</i>, including 150<i>l.</i> to
each of the twelve great Livery Companies of London. He
died 1601, aged eighty-one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bicknell</span>, Elhanan, of Herne Hill, Dulwich, a citizen
and Ironmonger, and great patron of the arts. He died
1861. His will was proved at 350,000<i>l.</i> His pictures sold at
Christie’s for 56,499<i>l.</i>; the sculpture, 2,145<i>l.</i>; drawings,
15,947<i>l.</i>; prints, 444<i>l.</i>; his houses and lands, 18,000<i>l.</i> He
had no fewer than ten Turners in his collection. He left
several charitable bequests.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cambell.</span>—Several of this family have proved to be
eminent Ironmongers. Sir Thomas, Lord Mayor 1610,
Master 1604 and 1613; Sir James, Lord Mayor 1629, and
three times Master; Robert, a merchant, and Master 1631.
Sir James was the principal benefactor, leaving nearly
50,000<i>l.</i>, as may be seen in Strype’s “Stow.” He died 1641,
and his portrait is in the Hall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Canning.</span>—Of this family William was Master 1617 and
1627, when he died. George (who died 1646) was for many
years the Company’s agent in Ireland, and was the ancestor
of the Prime Minister George Canning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carre</span>, John, 1571, his son in 1573, and Mrs. Carre in 1583,
left many bequests to the Company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chamberlin.</span>—This family was well represented on the
Company. There were Richard, George, and Robert.
Alderman Richard, Master 1560 and 1565, died November 19,
1566, and was buried in St. Olave, Old Jewry. His epitaph
stated:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clitherow.</span>—Alderman and Lord Mayor Sir Christopher;
Master 1618-1624; died 1642. He was son of Henry, three
times Master, who died 1607. See pedigree in the “History
of Hertfordshire.” A worthy benefactor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dane</span>, William, Alderman and Sheriff 1569, Master 1570-1573;
died November, 1579. Margaret, his widow, 1579,
was “a good woman.” She left many charities, including
the 12,000 faggots to the poor for firewood, which has been
made by the ignorant the more serious gift to burn them
with. Her portrait hangs in the Hall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Denham</span>, Sir William, descended from the Dinhams of
Normandy. Sheriff 1534, Master 1531 to 1548. Died
August 4, 1548. By a curious error in the codicil to the will
the Company were compelled to purchase the properties
previously bequeathed to them, including that known as the
Old Jewry Chambers. His portrait hangs in the Hall.
Curiously enough, a branch of the Denham family were
copyholders of Hackney in the reign of James I., and
removed to Plumstead. Of later years another branch
resided in Hackney, and the wife of the present writer is a
descendant of that branch, descended from the Alderman
Denham, and from the Thomas Denham, a City Corporator
early this century, and a member of the Court of the Ironmongers’
Company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Downe</span>, Robert, in 1556, gave premises in St. Sepulchre;
also for dinners, obits and plate. The site “Ironmongers’
Buildings” is now covered by the Holborn Valley Viaduct.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Draper</span>, Sir Christopher, Lord Mayor, 1566. Eight times
Master, the last time in 1581. A window formerly existing
at the Hall, with his portrait on it, was removed in 1845.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">East</span>, Robert, 1606, gave tapestry to the Hall, and 10<i>l.</i> for
“a drinckinge” at his burial.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">French</span>, George Russell, son of John French, Master 1823.
The son was chosen surveyor to the Company May, 1849.
He was a Shakespearean antiquary, and wrote many
interesting works, especially the compilation “Catalogue of
Antiquities” we have so often alluded to. He compiled a
very curious list of the Ironmongers’ Company, applying to
each a Shakespearean quotation. He died in October, 1881.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geffery</span>, Sir Robert, Lord Mayor 1686, Master 1667
and 1685. He died 1703, and was buried in St. Dionis,
Fenchurch Street, and when that church was pulled down
his remains were removed, July, 1878, to the Ironmongers’
burial-ground, Kingsland Road. By will, after many charitable
bequests, he left the residue of his estate for the
purchase of land, and the erection (in 1714) of the present
chapel and fourteen almshouses. The old twenty-nine rules
for the government will be found in Strype’s “Stow.” At the
date of their erection the almshouses were in “the suburbs.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grinsell</span>, Thomas, “Citizen and Ironmonger,” a well-known
parishioner of St. Dunstan’s-in-the-West, Fleet Street,
and famous for having been the Master of “the gentle angler,”
Izaak Walton, who became a member of the Company in
1618. The Grinsell family subsequently resided in Westminster.
About Thomas, see “Memorials of Temple Bar
and Fleet Street,” 1869, p. 80.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gyva</span>, John, about 1515 gave to the Company the hearse-cloth
or funeral-pall. It is of crimson velvet and cloth-of-gold
tissue, ornamented with fruit and flowers for centre-piece.
In the centre of each sides the Blessed Virgin Mary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
in glory crowned as Queen of Heaven, with figures of Saint
Elizabeth of Hungary, St. John Baptist, and St. John
Evangelist. Beyond the figures on each side the Company’s
arms, and at each end in cloth of gold a monstrance, representing
a silver-gilt shrine, jewelled, inscribed with the name
and date of John Gyva and Elizabeth, his wife. This pall
was long used for funerals. In 1532 it was only to be used
by members and their wives, but this exception was relaxed,
for in 1678 40<i>s.</i> was to be the fee for its use by strangers
generally. Elizabeth Gyva in 1534 gave the Company a
tenement, directing them to “remember” her in their
prayers for 100 years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hallwood</span>, Thomas, 1622, gave plate, exhibitions to
universities, &amp;c. His portrait hangs in the Hall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hanbey</span>, Thomas, 1782, provided for the education of two
children in Christ’s Hospital, and Mary, his wife, 1796, left
the interest of 300<i>l.</i> to provide for the repairs of the tomb of
her husband in St. Luke’s Churchyard, Old Street, and
residue of the interest among the poor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Handson</span>, Ralph, clerk to the Company, was a good
benefactor and kindly disposed, leaving in 1653 to the poor
members, to hospitals, and to the yeomanry for their half-yearly
repast, as already mentioned. His portrait hangs in
the Hall. He was cousin to Nicholas Leat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heylin</span>, Rowland, Sheriff 1624, Master 1614 and 1625,
died 1629. He gave 300<i>l.</i>, out of which a dinner and a
sermon were to be annually provided to commemorate the
Powder Plot deliverance, and loans made to poor young
freemen. His portrait is in the Hall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harvey</span>, Sir James, Alderman; Lord Mayor 1582; four
times Master. His son, Sir Sebastian, was Lord Mayor 1618,
Master 1600; wrote his name “Harvye.” Lady Harvey,
1620, gave 21<i>l.</i> for a dinner at the funeral of Sir Sebastian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hood</span>, Samuel, first Viscount, was presented with the
freedom 1783 in honour of his great victory. He died 1816.
His portrait by Gainsborough (presented by Lord Hood)
hangs in the Hall. We possess a characteristic letter written
by Lord Hood in 1811 with his left hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humfreys</span>, Sir William, Bart., Lord Mayor 1714, Master
1705, and gave a silver cup and cover. He acted as chief
butler at the coronation of George I. Died 1735, buried at
St. Mildred’s, Poultry, and when that church was pulled
down (1875) the Company desired to give him a “proper”
reinterment at Ilford, but, although the character of the
coffin showed that the body inside was possibly his, all the
silver plates and handles and ornaments had been stolen
long before, and so Sir William could not be identified, and
the remains were taken with the others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lane</span>, Ralph, Turkey merchant, gave to the Company, in
1712, a silver-gilt cup, upon which is engraved a coat of
arms, with thirty-two quarterings. It is interesting to note
that John Lane, the elder, in 1457, was one of the Company
who advanced 10<i>l.</i> towards purchasing the Hall property.
His son John gave 40<i>s.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lawrence.</span>—A well-known and respected name in the
City. Several have been members of the Company. John
Lawrans, about 1500, gave “a grete maser which hath sent
Lawrans in the bottom.” It weighed over 60 oz. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
John Lawrence, in 1731, gave a tankard. We may here
mention that</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Lawrence</span> is the patron saint of the company. The
old barge “head” represented the saint with the gridiron in
his hand. In the early churchwarden’s accounts of the parish
of St. Lawrence, Reading, are numerous curious entries
between 1520 and 1530, such as:—“For gildyng of Seynt
Lawrence gredyron, viij<i>d.</i>”; “to the peynters Wyff, dew for
gilding of Seynt Lawren, vj<i>s.</i> viij<i>d.</i>,” &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leat</span>, Nicholas, Alderman, three times Master, died 1631,
captain of the trained bands. He was an authority in agriculture
(<i>see</i> Gerard’s “Herbal,” 1597, p. 246). The sons presented
his portrait now in the court-room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lewen</span>, Thomas, Alderman and Sheriff, Master 1535, died
1557, founded the almshouses in Bread Street, now in
St. Luke’s. A good benefactor. His portrait is in the Hall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>, Thomas, died 1527, gave “a croft of garden
enclosed by ditches and wall” outside Cripplegate (now
St. Luke’s) of about 10 acres, which, with about an acre purchased
in 1595, comprises now 11½ acres, covered with some
360 houses. St. Luke’s Church was built and churchyard
formed on part of the ground. Portrait in Hall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Morris</span>, Richard, was Master in the Armada year, 1588.
Many members of the family have been in the Company
between 1568 and 1718. He died 1592. His daughter
married first Sir William Cockayne (Lord Mayor, 1619), and,
secondly, Henry Carey, Earl of Dover. From both husbands
peerages descend. Samuel Morris, in 1680, gave an iron box,
with keys, to hold the Company’s seal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Milne</span>, Sir David, K.C.B., admitted to the Freedom of
the Company with his superior officer, Lord Exmouth,
in 1817.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Newell</span>, Mrs. Ann, in 1544, gave a table and napkins—a
seasonable gift in those days. Her namesake, William
J. Newall, who died a liveryman of the Company in 1888, and
worth 257,000<i>l.</i>, seems to have forgotten in his will his poor
“brother-ironmongers”!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nicholl.</span>—This is an old family name on the company.
John Nicholl, of Canonbury, Master 1859, was a good friend
to the Company (and to the writer). He compiled a magnificent
account of the history of the Ironmongers, 1851
and 1866, and the original MS. “Records,” in six volumes,
are in the Company’s library. He died February 7, 1871,
aged eighty-one, and his portrait appropriately hangs in the
court-room next to that of Mr. Beck. His son, Edward
Hadham Nicholl, Esq., is the senior warden of the Company
this year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pellatt.</span>—Many representatives of this Sussex family
have been in the Company, including Apsley Pellatt, M.P.,
died 1863 (who gave a silver-mounted snuff-box), and
Thomas Pellatt, Clerk of the Company, died 1829. Apsley
Pellatt, of Lewes, grandfather of the M.P., was Master 1789.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pellew</span>, Edward, created Viscount Exmouth, 1816. The
hero of Algiers and the terminator of slavery there. Presented
with the freedom of the Company, January 31, 1817,
and with a sword by the City. The original grant of the
Company’s freedom, signed by T. Pellatt, the clerk, is in the
possession of a member of the Company. Portrait by Sir
William Beechey hangs in the Hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Price.</span>—This family has had many representatives in the
Company. John Price was buried at Clapham 1739; his
wife 1760. Sir Charles Price, Bart., Lord Mayor 1803, was
Master 1798. In his mayoralty he gave the magnificent cut-glass
chandelier now hanging in the Hall. His portrait also
hangs there. Among other papers the writer has the original
Privy Seal for the grant of the baronetcy. Sir Charles died
1818. His son was Master 1819 and died 1847. He was
succeeded by Sir Charles Rugge Price, who had a splendid
collection of engravings, including a choice copy of Rembrandt’s
“Hundred Guilder Piece”—Christ Healing the Sick—which
at the sale in 1867 sold for 1,180<i>l.</i>, the highest sum
ever paid for a single engraving.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare</span>, John, Alderman and Sheriff 1768, translated
to the Ironmongers’ from the Broderers’ 1767,
Master 1769. A large ropemaker at Shadwell. Buried at
Stepney, 1775. Gave silver candlesticks to the Company.
He was supposed to be descended from a branch of the
dramatist’s family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Slade</span>, Felix, son of Robert, of Doctors’ Commons, and
Walcot Place, Lambeth; Master 1803. The son was a collector
of choice articles and a great benefactor to the
British Museum and the nation. He died March 29, 1868.
He founded the Slade Professorship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thompson</span>, William, Alderman, M.P. Lord Mayor 1828
A wealthy ironfounder. Master 1829 and 1841; died 1854
His only daughter married the Earl of Bective, now
Marquis of Headfort. Among his gifts were two large silver
candlesticks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thorold.</span>—Several members have been on the Company
and served offices of Master, &amp;c.; also benefactors to the
poor. The family were of Harmeston Hall, county Lincoln,
which was sold in 1884 for 115,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walker</span>, Henry, made free in 1634, having served
apprentice to Robert Holland, was so extraordinary an individual
that John Taylor wrote and printed his “Life and
Progress of Henry Walker the Ironmonger,” 1642, and it is
now a very rare tract. Captain William Walker, Master
1684, gave in 1694 a large set of knives and forks, with
silver handles, for the Company’s future use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walton</span>, Izaak, “the gentle angler,” apprentice to Thomas
Grinsell, was, on November 18, 1618, “admitted and sworne
a free brother of this companie and payd for his admittance
xiij<i>d.</i> and for default of presentment and enrollment x<i>s.</i>”.
His portrait hangs in the Hall. He was warden of the
Yeomanry 1627, died December 15, 1683, and buried at
Winchester. A full account of him and his family will be
found in the “Memorials of Temple Bar and Fleet Street,”
1869, p. 82, and Pink’s and Wood’s “Clerkenwell,” p. 107.
The writer possesses a large amount of curious and original
matter relating to “good Izaak,” which he intends one day
to publish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Westwood.</span>—Several have been members. While Robert
was Master, 1828, among the eighty-five liverymen were
Lord Exmouth, Sir David Milne, two baronets, and two
aldermen. Robert, Master in 1861, gave a silver-gilt cup
and cover. William Henry, in 1878 and 1882, proved himself
very kindly disposed to the Company’s poor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woodward</span>, Mistress Katherine, in the seventeenth
century, left 200<i>l.</i> for poor scholars, prisoners, hospitals, and
poor maids’ marriages.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Young</span>, Richard, 1675, gave a silver salt, a caudle cup and
cover, and was excused serving office of Master. John, in
1695, gave the Company six pictures.</p>

<p>Such, then, are a few of the names of Ironmongers worthy
to be remembered. We have not exhausted, by a very long
way, our list, but we think the selection will prove that the
Ironmongers have had many good and true citizens in their
roll. Our wish is this: May they increase as years roll on,
and, as the toast is periodically given by the Master of the
Company, so do we echo it three times three—“The
Worshipful Company of Ironmongers, Root and Branch, and
may it Flourish for Ever!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The writer having so far completed the task he has set
himself, and briefly chronicled some of the most interesting
facts connected with his ancient Company, thinks it but
right to say that what he has now printed is only a small
portion of a larger history, which some time hence he
intends to produce for the benefit of the public at large, if
his life is spared to undertake the work. Having been
honoured by his brother freemen, as already stated in the
last chapter, he determined to prove he was not unmindful
of his duty, or the rights and privileges of his brethren,
whatever some persons may think to the contrary. He has,
therefore, ventured to print as succinct an account of their
history as it is possible to give in a small compass, and
Herbert’s “History,” and the “Some Account” of his old
friend John Nicholl being either out of print or too expensive,
probably the present will do as a temporary substitute
for the members until another is ready for publication.</p>

<h2 id="APPENDIX">APPENDIX.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE BLACKSMITHS’ COMPANY.</span></h2>

<p>The advance of technical education, the inauguration of
another trades exhibition promoted by a City Company,
and that Company the ancient Blacksmiths’ Guild, must be
our excuse for placing upon record some account of its
history from the earliest date known about it as a fraternity.</p>

<p>Of the origin of Guilds we have already had occasion to
speak in our history of the Ironmongers. Mr. Nicholl, the
historian of that Company, gives us some interesting facts in
his notes, and we cannot do better than quote his preliminary
words:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The art of working in metals was more highly esteemed than any other
by the Anglo-Saxons. Their best artisans were the clergy. Edgar
established a law that every priest, to increase knowledge, should
diligently learn some handicraft. Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury, to
the arts of music, engraving, painting, and writing, added the craft of a
smith, and was an expert workman. Stigand and Ethelwold, both
bishops, were celebrated for their mechanical skill. The chief smith was
a man of considerable distinction in the courts of the Anglo-Saxon kings
and his privileges and weregild exceeded those of any other craftsman.
Towards the period of the Conquest the manufacture of iron had considerably
increased, and the art of working it was better understood.
Steel and iron armour were common. At the time of the Domesday
Survey the City of Hereford had six smiths, who paid each one penny for
his forge, and made 120 pieces of iron from the king’s ore, receiving in
return a customary payment of three pence, and being free from all other
service. The City of Gloucester paid to the king 36 dicras of iron and
100 ductile rods to make nails for the king’s ships. Iron had now become
the principal manufacture of Gloucestershire, and in the reign of
Edward I. there is stated to have been no less than 72 furnaces in the
Forest of Dean for smelting it. The largest establishments of the Romans
for the manufacture of iron in Britain were in this county, but the
method, whatever it may have been, which they employed was imperfect
and the cinders of their numerous forges, wherever they are discovered,
are found to contain a very considerable portion of unsmelted metal.
The first smelting-furnace, and that which in all probability was used by
the Romans for the manufacture of iron, is supposed to be the air-bloomery;
it is described as a low conical structure, with small openings
at the bottom for the admission of air and a large orifice at top for carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
off the gaseous products of combustion. It was filled with charcoal
and ore in alternate layers, and the fire applied to the lowest part. How
long this simple contrivance continued in use we have no means of
ascertaining, the period to which it belongs being so very remote; there is
no doubt, however, that the next era of improvement in the manufacture
of iron was the introduction of bellows, and the construction of the blast-bloomery,
which greatly facilitated the process of smelting, and, by allowing
the construction of larger furnaces, considerably increased the manufacture.
The blast-bloomery, in process of time and the constant
progression of the arts, was superseded by what is denominated the blast-furnace.
This last improvement is supposed to have been introduced
during the early part of the sixteenth century; for in the seventeenth
century the art of casting in metal had arrived at a great degree of perfection,
and in the reign of Elizabeth there was a considerable export trade
of cast-iron ordnance to the Continent.</p>

</div>

<p>As “by hammer and hand all arts do stand,” so was the
origin of the Blacksmiths’ Guild in the nineteenth year of the
reign of Edward III., 1325. Like many others it is a
fraternity by prescription, subsequently incorporated by
Royal Charter. “The Articles of the Blacksmiths,” dated
the 46th of Edward III., <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1372, are enrolled in Letter-book
G, fo. 285, preserved among the Guildhall records, and a
most interesting and concise translation will be found in
Mr. Riley’s “Memorials of London,” 1868, p. 361. The
Articles specially provide against the introduction into the
City of inferior foreign-made work, and the forging of trademarks
was, of course, a serious matter. “Every master in the
said trade shall put his own mark upon his work, such as
heads of lances, knives and axes, and other large work, that
people may know who made them in case default shall be
found in the same.” Forgers of such mark were dealt with
without delay, and it is interesting to know that one of the
earliest of the overseers appointed resided near Holborn
Bridge (now the Viaduct), close to the Charity Trust Estate
of the present Company. No one was to be made free of the
Guild unless he was skilled in his work as an apprentice
should be, so that we may be sure the early blacksmiths truly
represented their “art and mystery.”</p>

<p>“The Ordinances of the Blacksmiths” are enrolled in the
Guildhall “Letter-book” H., fo. 292, and will be found
translated in Mr. Riley’s “Memorials,” p. 537. They are
dated the 18 Richard 2nd, 1394. No smith was to work
throughout the night, or to annoy his neighbours, and the
hours of work were to be from 6 o’clock in the morning to
8 o’clock in the evening in winter, and from the beginning of
daylight to 9 o’clock at night in summer. None to work in
his shop on a Saturday, or on the eve of a feast or holy day
after the first stroke of the vesper bell, under heavy fines and
penalties. Two wardens to be annually elected for their
government, and strict search to be made in the City and
suburbs for the detection of false wares. No one to make a
key for a lock unless he have the lock to make it by, and
nothing to be exposed for sale at any fair until the wardens
have certified it “good and lawful.”</p>

<p>Forty years afterwards we find another enrolment, and
among records where such an entry would never be looked
for—the Register Book of the Commissary of London,
labelled “Liber 3 More, 1418-1438,” folio 455, now preserved
in the Probate Registry, Somerset House. We are indebted
to Mr. J. R. Daniel-Tyssen for the discovery in 1852, and to
Mr. H. C. Coote for editing and printing them in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>

two of the brethren, Stephen Manne and William Mapull.</p>

<p>Although the Blacksmiths’ Guild was not in existence
when St. Dunstan played his harp, and worked at his forge
and anvil, we cannot forbear saying something about a prelate
who has, more than any other, raised the reputation of
the “art and mystery,” which after 500 years still flourishes
within the boundaries of great London City, and at the time
we are writing this gives a splendid proof that it is not wanting
in will or way to attempt the improvement of the trade
by advocating and supporting technical education.</p>

<p>Dunstan, to whose memory so many churches have been
dedicated, was born near Glastonbury, in county Somerset,
and educated at the Abbey. In subsequent years, when he
passed a retired life, he built himself a small cell, and enacted
there (if tradition holds its own) one of, if not the greatest
miracle upon record. He was a favourite with King
Athelstan, whom he much pleased by musical performances
on his harp, and many astounding tales have been handed
down to us about this instrument playing without being
touched, and rendering such musical and hitherto unknown
melody as enabled the humbler classes to be much imposed
upon. Dunstan died May 18, <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 988, so that he has been
dead just 900 years. And yet to-day is still recorded that
marvellous meeting he once had with “the evil one,” or, as
we were told in our youth, the Devil. Many a time did this
tempter “try his hand” upon our musical blacksmith. He
appeared to him in every shape and form, even as a beautiful
female, and certainly to our mind the most likely “to
draw.” Poor Dunstan in his little cell at Glastonbury, whenever
at his devotional practice as harpist, or using his forge
and anvil as blacksmith, was certain to receive a visit, and
his sweet song drowned by the black visitor’s unholy jeers.
At last the day of reckoning came, Dunstan seized a golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
opportunity when his tyrannical tormenter put in appearance
at the very time his forge was at work and his pincers hot.
Little was said, no doubt, but the doings were great—the
greatest ever recorded of man’s work—for</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">St. Dunstan, so the story goes,</div>
<div class="verse">Seized his sable Majesty by the nose,</div>
<div class="verse indent8">And made him loudly roar;</div>
<div class="verse">So loud, indeed, from North to South,</div>
<div class="verse">From East to West, like from thunder’s mouth</div>
<div class="verse indent8">It echoed a thousand miles and more.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the pulling of the evil one’s nose was but a part of the
transaction, for our blacksmith then and there pulled out his
parchment and made the enemy sign that famous declaration,
never in future to molest Holy Church or Holy men,
and keep aloof of all buildings in which hang the horseshoe.
It is not many years ago that in two streets in London this
emblem of protection or “luck” may have been seen—Dudley
Street, St. Giles’s, and Dean Street, Fetter Lane—the
latter place not a thousand miles, but only a few yards,
from where this account is printed. As for the hammer,
anvil and tongs of St. Dunstan, Mr. Lower in his notices of
the ironworks of Sussex, gives woodcuts of the three articles,
said to be “the famous originals, preserved at Mayfield in
that county, so noted for its iron. The anvil and tongs are
of no great antiquity, but the hammer with its iron handle
may be considered a mediæval relic.” A few years ago we
attended a sale of curiosities of more than the usual interest,
and which were the lifelong attention of Mr. Snoxall,
Charterhouse Square. One of the lots was the original anvil
and hammer of the “Harmonious Blacksmith,” from which
Handel composed his celebrated song, and we can endorse,
from a trial we made, the assertion of the MS. description
that Powell’s anvil produced B and E notes, as few anvils
have done, or are likely to do again.</p>

<p>St. Dunstan is the patron saint of the Goldsmiths’ Company,
and he figures in their hall both in picture and in
statue. The legend was a favourite one in their Lord Mayor’s
Show, especially in that of 1687, when in the trade pageant
the prelate seated on a chair of State, having a golden mitre
on his head, a crozier in one hand and tongs in the other,
surrounded by forges and anvils and blacksmith at work,
taught the devil the oft-repeated lesson not to intrude on
forbidden ground. We might multiply evidences of the
popularity of the famous legend, but we have said enough,
and must proceed with our Company’s history.</p>

<p>In the first year of the reign of Henry VII. (1485) both
the Blacksmiths’ and Spurriers’ guilds will be found in the
list given by Campbell, vol. i. p. 4; and a few years later, in
1502, standing in precedency the 36th Company, the Blacksmiths
had a livery of sixteen, and the Spurriers, standing
the 46th, had six. When Henry VIII. and Queen Katherine
“shall pass by towards their Coronation,” the same Companies
sent members to represent them, and in the eighth
year of that King’s reign, 1517, it was settled that in precedency
in the future the Blacksmiths should be the 41st
Company and the Spurriers the 46th. There were then
about sixty Companies in the City, but of these ten were not
in the “clothing,” that is to say, had a livery.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">St. Dunstan gives a Practical Reminder of the Power of the
Horseshoe.</span></p>
</div>

<p>It was by Charter, dated April 20, 1571, that the two Companies
were united under the usual conditions of a body corporate
and with the powers and privileges of making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
ordinances for the government of the Company. The Charter
was confirmed by James I. in his second year, March 21,
1604-5. Meanwhile the precepts poured into the Blacksmiths
as they did to other Companies, and in May, 1595,
out of 12,000 quarters of corn stored at the Bridgehouse in
the preceding November by the City Guilds, only some 779
quarters remained, and ten of these belonged to this Company.
The Corn Custom, as described by Herbert, was a
heavy tax, and often so tyrannical was the system of levy
that some of the wardens were sent to prison in 1632 for
neglecting to obey orders.</p>

<p>In 1609 King James I. submitted to the City of London
his scheme for the plantation of the forfeited lands of the
O’Neills and the O’Dohertys in the province of Ulster in the
North of Ireland; and the same King founded a new order
of Knighthood, purchasable by those desirous of helping to
maintain the authority of the King in future against the
rebels in Ireland. That order of Knighthood is the present
Baronetage, and in proof of its origin every person so titled
bears in his shield of arms the red hand of Ulster. The
citizens of London paid James I., from first to last, for their
Ulster estates more than 60,000<i>l.</i> The difficulty then arose
as to the management, and so, in 1613, the whole property
was partitioned off into twelve shares (according to the sum
subscribed by each of the twelve principal Guilds, who,
having raised 40,000<i>l.</i>, showed that each of the twelve had
paid 3,333<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>). With the twelve principal companies
certain minor ones, having paid a certain sum, joined in the
scheme, and accordingly, the Blacksmiths, subscribing 64<i>l.</i>
with seven others, became associated with the Vintners, who
held possession until the year 1736, when they sold the whole
estate, reserving only a rent charge.</p>

<p>There are many interesting documents extant relating to
the Blacksmiths and the Blacksmiths’ Company. We do
not lack the will to publish all the information we could give
about their progress, but for the greatest of all reasons—want
of room, our space being but limited—we must limit
our notes to a few of the most important events.</p>

<p>In 1607 Thomas Bickford, Master of the Company,
prosecuted Nicholas Lowe for carrying on the trade of a
smith, he not being free of the City; and in March, 1612,
the curious controversy about Daubigny’s patent set all the
machinery of the Royal Commissioners and the City into
high-pressure activity. It appears that Clement Dawbney,
<i>alias</i> Daubigny, desired to have a renewal of his patent for
cutting iron into small rods, and that restraint should be
placed upon the importation of foreign iron so cut. His
petition to the Commissioners of Suits was backed by shipwrights,
masters, and nailmakers, who particularly condemned
foreign iron. The Commissioners, being unable to
decide, referred the matter to three of the City Companies,
the Ironmongers, Blacksmiths, and Carpenters. The record
books of the Ironmongers contain many interesting details of
the inquiry made by that company into the question in
dispute, and two of the most active members in the debate
were two of the Chamberlyn family—George (then Master,
in 1612) and Richard (who had been Master two years
previous). The Nailmakers reminded the Commissioners,
“as the fathers of the Commonwealth,” that a private patent
deprived the poor of their trade and labour; that one or two
enriched themselves at the cost of the many. “Wee allwaies
have in evrie C. weight eleven or twelve pounds of ends or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
refuse iron and pay for that after 2<i>d.</i> the lb., whereof we
make againe ever hardly a halfpenny for everie pound.”
Also, “We affirme as workmen that especially it is that the
Flemmish iron is as good and servicable and worketh as well
as or owne English iron.” The result was a temporary benefit,
for the patent was called in; although Sir Francis Bacon, one
of the Commissioners, having made a special report subsequently,
in 1617, that the monopoly, or patent, would
benefit not only the Blacksmiths but the Nailmakers, and
was only opposed by Burrell, who had set up a similar ironworks
at Danbury, the King renewed the patent, December 11,
1618. The granting of similar monopolies caused no end
of bickerings and ill-feeling, and ruin was by no means
uncommon among those who neither had capital with which
to defend their rights, nor interest at Court to prevent that
“bribery and corruption” so common in the surroundings of
our seventeenth century monarchy. When, in the previous
reign, the Earl of Oxford had endeavoured to obtain one of
these patents of privilege against the Company of Pewterers,
“whereby he would have undone the pewterers, their wives
and families,” Queen Elizabeth acted with discretion—not
always a virtue with all-powerful royalty—for she actually
granted the Earl’s desired privilege to the company itself!</p>

<p>We will now give a full copy of a petition which the
Blacksmiths sent to the Privy Council in December, 1631.
It is directed to “The Right Honᵇˡᵉ the Lords and others of
His Maᵗʸˢ most Honᵇˡᵉ Privy Counsell,” by “the Mʳ Wardens
and Assistants of the Society of Blacksmiths, London”:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Humbly sheweth—</p>

<p>That notwᵗʰstanding yoʳ petʳˢ great care and good endeavʳ by making
searches and orders, according to their oath and charter, whereby to
suppress disorders and abuses in deceitfull working and making of ironwork,
yet by the evill example and refractorie of some ill-affected persons
of their society, whose names are here under menconed, their authority and
orders are slighted and disgraced, and many who have been heretofore
obedient and conformable doe now by their meanes continue refractory
and disorderly, and yoʳ petʳˢ and their charters are so notoriously
scandalised and abused that of themselves they cannot reforme the same,
nor have they any hope of redresse therefore but by yoʳ honoʳˢ favor.</p>

<p>They therefore most humbly beseeche yoʳ honoʳˢ to take their great
wrong and just grievance into yoʳ hoᵇˡᵉ considerations. And to be pleased
to send for the said disorderly and obstinate persons hereunder named
before you. And to take such order wᵗʰ them for their conformity and
obedience to the ordinances made and to be made for the good governmᵗ of
the said society and prevencon. of deceits &amp; abuses as to yʳ grave and hoᵇˡᵉ
wisdome shall seem meete.</p>

<p>And they shall ever praye for yoʳ honoʳˢ.</p>

</div>

<p>The names of the six disorderly Blacksmiths appear to
have been:—George Johnson, William Bickford, Hanns
Garrett, Leonard Berars, William Browne, and Henry Baily.
Whether their nonconformity and other troubles led the
Company to obtain a new charter we know not, but it is
quite clear they did obtain one of Charles I., in his fourteenth
year, and dated February 16, 1638-39. By this new grant all
persons carrying on the business or trade of a blacksmith or
spurrier within the City of London or suburbs four miles
round were incorporated as “the Keepers or Wardens and
Society of the Art or Mystery of Blacksmiths, London,” to
have four keepers or wardens and twenty-one assistants, and
to make by-laws and ordinances, to examine all spurs, ironwork
made, &amp;c., within the City and four miles round, and to
hold lands to the extent of 30<i>l.</i> above the former charter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
allowance of 30<i>l.</i> In accordance with this grant and power
the Company framed new orders (confirmed by the Judges),
dated in December, 1640, and one of these allowed the Company
to “call, nominate, choose, and admit into the
yeomanry of the said Society such and so many persons
being freemen of the said Society as they should think meet,
honest, and of ability to be called and admitted into the said
yeomanry.”</p>

<p>This shows that the Company anciently comprised the
Livery, yeomanry, and freemen, and the clerk believes that
the freemen were the journeymen and the yeomanry the
master blacksmiths. Under the <i>Quo warranto</i> writ of
Charles II. the Company surrendered with the other Guilds,
but were reinstated to their rights and privileges by
James II. in the first year of his reign by a charter dated
March 18, 1684-85.</p>

<p>The Act of Common Council of June 9, 1658, compelled
all persons carrying on the trade to be free of the Company.
Fifty years later the Company took special means to enforce
it; but, like many of the other rights and privileges of the
Guilds, through the altered conditions of trading the power
of the Company has not been exercised for many years. The
following entry from the books of the Founders’ Company,
as extracted by Mr. Williams and printed in his “Annals,”
is sufficiently interesting to merit a place in our present
notice of the Blacksmiths:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">1660, Sept. 3. Memorandum.</p>

<p>That upon this day the mastʳ and wardens did visit all the ffounders
shopps in Bartholomew Lane and Lothebury—as well of them that were
free of the ffounders company as those of the coppersmiths, and found in
the shop of John Lucas one lock of brass fitted in wᵗʰ 20 oz. of lead and
one 4-lb. weight unsealed, unsized, and unmarked with the owner’s stamp,
which work was brought into the Hall.</p>

</div>

<p>Founders’ Hall stood in Lothbury (hence the name
of Founders’ Hall Court), and was let to the Electric
Telegraph Company in 1853. The Founders of Bartholomew
Lane and Lothbury have long since departed to other
quarters of the City, and the sites of their ancient trading
are now occupied by the great monetary fraternities, the
Bank of England and other banks, and the Capel Court of
the Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>In May, 1750, the Committee of the Corporation of London
specially reported on several petitions presented by masters
and journeymen freemen, and it was resolved that the
matters complained of required some regulation; that the
Court of Aldermen any Tuesday may have the power to grant
to any master freeman liberty to employ non-freemen, but
under certain restrictions; and that all proceedings and
prosecutions rest in the name of the Chamberlain, who,
however, only represents the City, and does not obtain any
personal benefit under such action.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Horseshoe puts to Flight the Devil, and Pursues the “Evil One”

</div>

<p>According to the returns made to the Royal Commissioners,
the Blacksmiths’ Company now comprises four
keepers or wardens, twenty-one assistants, the Livery, and
the yeomanry. The freedom of the Company is obtainable
by servitude (as an apprentice), by patrimony, and by
redemption. Formerly a quarterage of 4<i>s.</i> per annum was
collected, but this caused much trouble in the collection.
Females were formerly admitted, but none during the last
twenty years. For thirty years previous to 1833 the admissions
or calls to the Livery were often one or two only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
year, the highest years being 1805, 1810, and 1818, when
ten, eleven, and ten respectively were admitted. During the
same period the freemen numbered from six to twenty a
year; in 1813 and 1818 the actual admittances were twenty-one.
In 1834 about three-fifths of the Livery were, or had
been, smiths, and of the whole Company nearly one-half were
of the trade.</p>

<p>There is one advantage in this Company—the calls to the
Livery go by rotation from the lists of the yeomanry, and
according to seniority. In 1882 there were eighty-three
freemen and eighty-one liverymen. As deaths take place
a fresh “call” is made, although in the nine years ending
1879 only thirty-two were admitted freemen. Another
difficulty has arisen as regards apprentices; only three were
admitted in the past ten years. Persons, even freemen, have
been led astray by the “know-nothings” of society, and
have simply been persuaded to believe that the City apprenticeship
is now of no value. We know different; and
hence we heartily applaud the endeavours of the Company
of Blacksmiths and their energetic clerk, Mr. W. B. Garrett,
in holding the exhibition in 1889 in the Ironmongers’ Hall,
and promoting technical education among the rising generation
of the trade, art, or mystery. The Corporation of
London also proposes to make the “indenture” more conformable
to the times, and this, too, is a step in the right
direction.</p>

<p>The Blacksmiths’ Company now holds its meetings at Guildhall.
Formerly they met in the Blacksmiths’ Hall standing
on Lambeth Hill, Doctors’ Commons, which in Hughson’s
time (1806) was “a much neglected structure,” and yet “a
good brick building with very convenient and stately apartments.”
This building formed part of the City lands of the
Corporation of London, and by indenture dated in February,
1746, was granted on a forty years’ lease by the City to “the
Wardens, Keepers, and Society of the Mystery or Art of the
Blacksmiths.” It is described as situate in the parish of
St. Mary Magdalene, Old Fish Street, having a frontage to
Lambeth Hill of 76 feet 6 inches, and then used by the
Company as their hall, &amp;c. When the lease expired, the
Blacksmiths held their meetings, as we have said, at Guildhall,
and do so still.</p>

<p>The return made to the Commissioners of 1880 states,
“The Company is not possessed of plate, pictures or furniture,”
but a loving cup, in private hands, of silver, was
presented to the Company by Christopher Pym, upon his
admission as clerk in 1665. The front of the stem that
supports the bowl is occupied by a figure of Vulcan as a
smith at his anvil, on which is engraved the motto of the
Company, “By Hammer and Hand all Arts doe Stand.” On
the outside of the bowl are also engraved the Company’s
arms, which were confirmed by Sir William Segar, Garter,
June 24, 1610.</p>

<p><i>Arms</i>: Sa. a chev. or. between 3 hammers ar. handled of
the second, ducally crowned of the last.</p>

<p><i>Crest</i>: On a wreath a mount vert; thereon a phœnix with
wings indorsed proper, firing herself with the sunbeams of
the last.</p>

<p>The motto of the Company in ancient times was: “As God
will so be it.”</p>

<p>The Blacksmiths’ is not a rich corporation, and the only
charity it possesses is that founded by Edward Prestyn in
June 1557. He left five houses in Fleet Lane and Old Bailey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
charged with the simple trust for the bestowal of 4<i>s.</i> per
annum among “the poor artists” of the Company. As a
proof that the Company carry out the trust in accordance
with the spirit which prompts right-minded citizens, the
Blacksmiths receive a rental from these premises of 136<i>l.</i> a
year, and yet pay away in charity 12<i>l.</i> per annum each to
twelve poor persons of the Company, being 8<i>l.</i> more than
the amount received! This would appear to be a mystery
were it not explained that the Company privately purchased
some other small properties, the rents from which
help to keep themselves in existence, and enable them to
augment the pensions of their poorer brethren.</p>

<p>We cannot omit to say a word or two about another
society which bears the arms and the motto of the London
Guilds, but is known as the Smiths’ Company of Newcastle-on-Tyne.
Like the Blacksmiths, the Smiths are an ancient
fraternity, for its earliest ordinance is dated 1436, and among
the peculiar enactments was that no Scotchman should be
taken as an apprentice, or allowed to work for a member
under a penalty of 40<i>s.</i>—a large sum in those days. In
1664 the branches of the trade represented on the Company
were numerous, and in 1677 they were incorporated,
having four wardens (one to be an anchor-smith), and
twelve assistants, four of each to represent anchor-smiths,
locksmiths, and farriers’-blacksmiths. Their hall adjoined
the Blackfriars in Newcastle; the ground-floor room, a
chapel, was the room in which homage was done by
the Scottish King to the King of England. In 1824 there
were seventy-seven members belonging to this Smiths’
Company.</p>

<p>There have been many noteworthy members of the
Blacksmiths’ Guilds, although the custom of the City in
olden time compelled the chief Magistrate to be “one of the
twelve.” Consequently the names of those citizens in this
Company who have served the offices of Lord Mayor and
sheriffs have been limited, and so far as we can learn the
earliest only dates back to the end of the last century, when
Thomas Baker, exactly a century ago—in 1789—was one of
“the eyes of the Mayor” (as Stow quaintly describes the
sheriffs), serving in the mayoralty of the celebrated William
Pickett, who originated the grand improvement without
Temple Bar, a full account of which will be found in the
“Memorials” of that edifice published in 1869. The late
Alderman James Abbiss was a Blacksmith, and one of the
sheriffs in 1859, and in turn would have served as Lord
Mayor had not illness compelled him to resign his gown.</p>

<p>We have numerous interesting references to the wills and
other evidences of the Blacksmiths of old London, but want
of space prevents even a summary. Two only, and these a
century apart, are sufficiently curious to mention. William
Reason, in 1568, left his livery-gowns to his brother and
cousin, and to his apprentice William one of the vices in his
shop and half of his files and tools. Industrious apprentices
were thought of by their masters in those days. “And
furder,” continues Mr. Reason, “I bequeathe to the Company
of Blackesmythes being of the lyvery that shall attende
upon my bodye to the buriall for a repaste or drincking to
be had and bestowed amongst them twentie shillings.” The
citizens of old London never expected their brethren to
work for nothing, and funerals with the City Companies,
especially with those who possessed halls, were of daily
occurrence, as a reference to the “Diary of Henry Machyn,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
1550-1563, printed by the Camden Society in 1848, will amply
prove. In 1674 William Rawlings, who requested to be
buried in St. Stephen’s Church, Coleman Street, and possessed
much property about London, was a benefactor to the poor
of Bromley and Bow, Middlesex. Joseph Thornhill, also a
Blacksmith, who was buried at Hampstead, left by will in
1718 all his property adjacent to the well-known “Pindar of
Wakefield,” St. Pancras, and in which house he some time
dwelt, in trust for the benefit of his two daughters. An
account of this celebrated tavern and tea-gardens will be
found at page 58 of Pinks and Wood’s “History of Clerkenwell.”</p>

<p>Finally, we can but echo the sentiments expressed in the
return to the Royal Commissioners in 1880:—“The objects
of the establishment of the Blacksmiths’ Guild were (1) the
promotion of good fellowship; (2) the protection and
encouragement of the trade the name of which is borne by
the Company;” and that the present Company “do all that
is in their power” to attain the objects of such foundation
whenever opportunity presents itself. The opportunity has
been given them in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1889 to promote technical education
by holding an exhibition at Ironmongers’ Hall, and, as it is
their first effort, so do we sincerely hope it is the forerunner
of many successful ones in the future.</p>

<h2 id="THE_EXHIBITION">THE EXHIBITION.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Reprinted from <span class="smcap">The Ironmonger</span>, March 30, 1889.</i>)</p>

<p>The exhibition of articles specially applicable to the
blacksmith’s art has been held this week in the Ironmongers’
Hall, Fenchurch Street. When a month ago
(February 23) we called attention to the competition that
had been opened by the Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths,
we expressed a hope that, although it was their first effort, it
might prove a successful one; and it is a pleasure to us to
be able to chronicle that a most valuable and interesting
proof has been given that on English soil there are still to
be found journeymen and industrious apprentices who
can turn out “by hammer and hand” some very creditable
work.</p>

<p>Like most of the first exhibitions that have been held for
the promotion of technical education, the Blacksmiths’ has
not been an extensive one. Only twenty-eight exhibitors
sent in specimens, and only two dozen of these were competitors.
But, if the quantity was small, the quality was
good, and, we must say, far exceeded our expectations. Each
exhibit was limited in weight to 20 lbs., so that the entire
collection was easily arranged upon tables, &amp;c., in the court-room
of the Ironmongers’ Company, who had willingly lent
their brother-blacksmiths a most interesting apartment,
which effectively added to the exhibition.</p>

<p>The exhibits comprised works by apprentices or youths,
and works by journeymen—in the former three sections, and
two prizes offered in each; in the latter three prizes. The
apprentices or youths were in the respective sections not to
exceed seventeen, nineteen, or twenty-one years of age,
“the work to be pure hammer-work of his own production
of any article of ornament or utility.” The journeymen’s
work was to be specially “table ornamentation or panel,”
the three prizes being 10<i>l.</i>, 7<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>, and 5<i>l.</i>, both apprentices
and journeymen to have a certificate of merit in addition.
The majority of the exhibitors were of the metropolis, but in
a few instances the North, even as far off as Midlothian, sent
competitors.</p>

<p>The judges met at Ironmongers’ Hall on Tuesday last to
inspect the exhibits, and were in several instances sorely
tried, for most of the work sent in was, as we stated, very
creditable. The Blacksmiths called to their aid skilled
practical craftsmen outside their own body, so that the
decisions arrived at must be considered eminently satisfactory.
The general public viewed the exhibits on Wednesday
and Thursday, and on Friday (yesterday) afternoon the
prizes were awarded to the successful competitors in the fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Hall of the Ironmongers in the presence of a numerous
company. The following were the successful recipients:—</p>

</div>

<p>In the preface to their list of exhibits the Company
(through their energetic clerk, Mr. W. B. Garrett) appeal to
exhibitors:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Blacksmiths’ Company initiate this exhibition in the hope that
British workmen will once more come to the front, and show that they can
make as good and as elegant articles, both for use and ornament, as can
the foreign artisan. Many persons who visited the Italian Exhibition last
year saw what that country could produce, and must have been struck by
the number of articles in ornamental ironwork sold, and, in many
instances, in which copies were ordered. Why does not the English workman
endeavour to follow—shall I not say lead?—in such work, and so retain
in this country a growing and profitable industry?</p>

</div>

<p>We can endorse this appeal, and hope that the first exhibition
may be but the forerunner of many others, each to be
more successful than its predecessor.</p>

<p>The Blacksmiths expressed their best thanks to the Ironmongers
for so kindly lending their hall, as also to Sir P. C.
Owen and his staff at the South Kensington Museum for
sending on loan a most interesting and valuable collection of
ancient ironwork, chiefly of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and
seventeenth century. Among the articles exhibited were:—</p>

<ul>
<li>Keys of various countries.</li>
<li>Fire-dog (Venetian), sixteenth century.</li>
<li>Prow of a gondola, fifteenth century.</li>
<li>Knocker (Italian), fifteenth century.</li>
<li>Knocker (German), about 1600.</li>
<li>Candlesticks and snuffer-stands.</li>
<li>Locks, various dates.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the wardens of the Blacksmiths’ Company, Mr. J. F.
Clarke, sent for exhibition several interesting articles, including
a large representation of the armorial shield of the
Company, whose motto is: “By Hammer and Hand all Arts
do Stand.”</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
